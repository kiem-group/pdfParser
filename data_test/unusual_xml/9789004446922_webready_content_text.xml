<title>Redefing Power: Emperor and Emperorship in the Fourth Century <sc>AD</sc></title>
<p>&#x201C;The authority of an emperor depended not exclusively on the power he possessed, it depended also on the way imperial power was presented and perceived.&#x201D;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN080001"><sup>1</sup></xref> These words encapsulate what has become the rationale of contemporary studies on the figure of the emperor, that is, how he became a symbol upon which politics, culture and religion ultimately converged. Both literary works of varied genres, and visual representations &#x2013; statues, coins, public buildings, honorific inscriptions<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN080002"><sup>2</sup></xref> &#x2013; were created and displayed in order to imprint the emperor&#x2019;s image on the collective consciousness of his subjects.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN080003"><sup>3</sup></xref> This complex web of media helped, among other things, to disseminate the political supremacy and legitimacy of the ruler, naturalising and universalising the experience of Roman imperial power.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN080004"><sup>4</sup></xref> The emperor himself appeared, and was perceived, in the context of an ideologically engineered framework, supported by images of his person which changed over time. Such perceptions were also defined by the expectations and approaches of different communities and individual subjects.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN080005"><sup>5</sup></xref></p>
<p>Over the course of the twentieth century, our understanding of the concepts, images, and ideas relating to the representation of empire and emperor has grown significantly through studies that draw on a variety of methodologies; some centring on philology and others focusing on history. Research on ceremonial occasions and the (re)presentation of the monarchy (Alf&#x00F6;ldi 1970; Straub 1964 [1939]; Salzman 2015) is especially noteworthy in this regard, as are the explorations of ceremonial practices and the visual arts (MacCormack 1981, McCormick 1985; Teja 1993; Lehnen 1997; Manders 2012). Other analyses have addressed the ways and means by which the message and experience of the emperor&#x2019;s hegemonic power was communicated to all citizens of the empire (Nore&#x00F1;a 2011; Wienand 2012). Likewise, there has been no shortage of studies examining the specific images that each emperor created and communicated about himself (Delbrueck 2010 [1933]; Bardill 2012). More recently, the role played by other agents &#x2013;powerful and marginal groups, political and intellectual elites, religious and ethnic minorities &#x2013; in the context of political communication, as well as in the dynamics of the formulation, redefinition, and interpretation of the image of the Emperor in relation to a wide range of publics, has also been the focus of significant scholarly discussion (Slootjes 2011; Smith 2011; Kleijn and B&#x00E9;noist 2013; Wienand 2015; Lenski 2016). Of equal interest are explorations of how different expectations and approaches (for instance shared tradition and identity) among individual and community audiences may have shaped such political communication concerning the image of the emperor and of the empire (Brown 1992; Hekster 2015, Lenski 2016). At the same time, the rhetorical techniques deployed in imperial panegyrics have been studied in depth and detail, disclosing a plurality of layers of meaning, oratorical strategies, and implicit political philosophy, as well as the reception and recodification of messages communicated in other genres and formats (Pernot 1993; Whitby 1998; Rees 2002, 2012; van Hoof 2014, Quiroga Puertas 2017, Burgersdijk-Ross 2018, Omissi 2018; Omissi-Ross 2020).</p>
<p>The range and scope of these perspectives have provided a clearer and more detailed understanding of how the idea of imperial power was shaped, transmitted, and received in Late Antiquity. In this context, by capitalising on this multidisciplinary field of studies the research project <italic>Romanitas Principum</italic> has been created with the aim to study in greater detail the interactions between the different mechanisms involved in the process of imperial representation between the reigns of Constantine and Theodosius <sc>I</sc>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN080006"><sup>6</sup></xref> The main goal is to excavate the &#x201C;image of the emperor&#x201D; in both real and metaphorical terms as an icon<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN080007"><sup>7</sup></xref> of imperial identity. The scope of <italic>Romanitas Principum</italic> centres on the representation of late antique emperors. This first stage focuses on Constantine, Julian, and Theodosius given their dimension as contrasting figures, and thought-provoking emblems of the specific characteristics of fourth-century politics, religion, culture, and society. This research project also questions whether it is possible to outline the development of new symbols in the imperial imagination as they were transmitted up and down the social ladder, from the emperor or elite groups to other social classes, from west to east across the empire, from pagan to Christian contexts, and vice versa. Likewise, <italic>Romanitas Principum</italic> seeks to reflect on these shifts as a way to a clearer understanding of the &#x2018;shared&#x2019; and the &#x2018;different&#x2019; in social or cultural terms.</p>
<p>These are some of the themes that were addressed in the international workshop <italic>Emperors and Emperorship in Late Antiquity: Images and Narratives</italic> held at the University of Navarra, Pamplona (Spain) on 17 and 18 February 2017. Discussions centred on a set of open questions: What are the interrelationships between the language of rhetoric and the code of images, from Constantine to Theodosius? How is the study of visual and/or textual imperial images shaped by the fact that they were produced and promoted at the behest of the emperor and with his authority, by intellectual elites, local powers, other groups and individuals? How did political and religious vocabulary change in representing the emperor and his enemies? What might contemporary literary theories contribute to the interpretation of textual images from this period? What new light might other approaches, less commonly explored thus far, shed on how the emperor made his &#x2018;presence&#x2019; felt among his subjects?</p>

<title>Revisiting Imperial Representations</title>
<p>These questions constitute the underlying issues of the contributions presented in this volume, which considers representations of material culture and texts as interconnected sources that engaged with and reacted to each other. Take, for instance, the discussion about the Arch of Constantine and other monuments commemorating the emperor&#x2019;s victories in chapters 1 and 2 based on a number of sources that replicated and dialogued with each other &#x2013; especially when it came to war issues, such as the consideration of external and internal enemies, as well as the relevance of <italic>spolia</italic>. A similar approach can be found in Garc&#x00ED;a Ruiz&#x2019;s work (chapter 4), in which it is proven how Julian&#x2019;s <italic>Caesars</italic> was composed as a response to previous portraits of glorified emperors. In this way, the texts and different forms of material culture dealt with in this volume have been interpreted from a multimodal approach in order to try to shed some light on how the patterns of representation of emperorship in the fourth century worked.</p>
<p>In doing so, we believe that this volume can contribute to understand the processes involved in the choice of visual and textual imperial representations that started in the Constantinian period. This was a time that radically transformed and conditioned the artistic and literary models of subsequent generations, imbuing the existing symbols with new meaning, as well as creating a number of new symbols. Among the latter, the main innovations in Constantinian imperial (self-)representation concern the relationship between the emperor and the divine. It is not difficult to find sources in which the divine sends messages to Constantine in dreams and visions, assuring him of victory and success. We are told, for example, that in 310 the god Apollo, accompanied by Victory, promised him a reign to last thirty years;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN080008"><sup>8</sup></xref> later, on the eve of the Battle of the Milvian Bridge, the Christian God assured him of triumph and offered his symbol as guarantee of victory.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN080009"><sup>9</sup></xref> Both stories are likely to have originated with the emperor or his entourage, and were soon echoed in panegyric texts and other modes of iconography.</p>
<p>This type of narrative helped Constantine&#x2019;s family to reframe the notion of emperorship in accordance to his political and religious agenda. Apollo was the god both of his father, Constantius Chlorus, and of Claudius Gothicus, the emperor to whom Constantine wished to be linked. Dynastic legitimacy was likewise based on this cult of the &#x2018;family&#x2019; god, rather than the gods of the Tetrarchs, from whom he wished to distance himself. From 310 to 324, Constantine not only used the imagery of the sun, but also superimposed or assimilated his own image into that of the sun, in his coin iconography. In many ways, this ongoing devotion to the Sun God reflected a much deeper obsession with the nature of light and its power as a metaphor. Far from shedding his initial fascination with the power of light, Constantine maintained it from the beginning to the end of his reign. Light also served as a beacon of unwavering consistency in his public self-presentation, even as he transformed himself from a pagan to a Christian ruler. The messages his subjects decoded from this complex of ideas were thus bound to be fraught with ambivalence and at times contradiction.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN080010"><sup>10</sup></xref></p>
<p>Apropos of this paradigm of change and continuity in the religious arena, Torres&#x2019; contribution (chapter 3) aims to elucidate whether the purple took on new meanings or nuances for Constantine and his image-makers by comparing and contrasting Latin encomiastic testimonies with Eusebius&#x2019; <italic>Life of Constantine</italic>. As in the contemporaneous <italic>Panegyrici Latini</italic>, in the opening passages of Eusebius&#x2019; <italic>Life</italic>, purple garments signified imperial dignity in accordance with Roman tradition. But in the Council of Nicaea scene,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN080011"><sup>11</sup></xref> Torres suggests, purple is the light and brightness that emanate from the Augustus when he assumes the role of <italic>episcopus maximus</italic>. Purple becomes a reflection of divine light, which the ruler somehow transmits from above. The cultural context of Eusebius and his audience is that of the Judeo-Christian Bible tradition.</p>
<p>Another significant aspect in the display of the imperial image is the celebration of triumphs. Traditionally, military victory underscored the outstanding qualities and capabilities of the <italic>princeps</italic>, and the triumph was the most prestigious sign of military success.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN080012"><sup>12</sup></xref> Military triumph had long been celebrated, but Constantine went to extraordinary lengths in this regard. In his contribution on Constantine&#x2019;s Arch, Burgersdijk (chapter 2) points out that in 315 the Roman Senate dedicated a &#x2018;monument in stone&#x2019; to extol the emperor who had conquered all his rivals and surpassed his predecessors. The formula of the <italic>arcus triumphis insignis</italic> could be interpreted literally as a self-referential &#x2018;stone monument full of triumphs&#x2019;. Constantine&#x2019;s triumph (which would range from the <italic>profectio</italic> to the battle in Verona to the <italic>ingressus Vrbis</italic>) depicted on the frieze was also to surpass triumphant representations of past emperors to whom Constantine is compared. Contemporary panegyrists in 313 and 321 asserted this interpretation.</p>
<p>The range and number of inscriptions, coins, medallions, reliefs, literary praise-poems such as Optatian&#x2019;s <italic>Morphogrammata</italic>, as well as the architecture of Constantinople itself, &#x201C;the city of Constantine&#x2019;s Victory&#x201D;, are proof enough of the fact that Constantine and his court, comprising intellectual elites and local powers, situated the high praise of triumph at the heart of his imperial (self-)representation. Yet, curiously enough, this tendency of glorification and magnification of the emperor&#x2019;s heroic accomplishments became an invective topos. In this way, Garc&#x00ED;a Ruiz (chapter 4) argues that Julian subverted and ridiculed Roman emperors&#x2019; deed narratives, thus implicitly criticising Constantine&#x2019;s large-scale propaganda.</p>
<p>Another element worthy of attention in such representations of triumph and victory is the image of enemies defeated in civil war. In his contribution (chapter 1), Tantillo explores the surviving evidence for this representation of the internal enemy on public media in imperial Rome from Constantine to Theodosius and beyond. Tantillo analyses all the epigraphic records of <italic>tyrannus</italic> as &#x2018;usurper&#x2019; and reads them in relation to visual and textual elements. The imagery was probably created to represent Maxentius in 312&#x2013;313, but Constantine&#x2019;s appreciation of it prompted him to make it his own. Along the same lines, Burgersdijk (chapter 2) points out the irony in the fact that the original commissioner of the Arch &#x2013; that is, Maxentius &#x2013; appears in the inscription as a &#x2018;tyrant&#x2019;.</p>
<p>Epigraphic and figurative evidence indicates that such monumental celebration of victory in internal conflicts was a phenomenon confined to Rome, and possibly to Constantinople where material remains are scarce. The transmission of the &#x2018;tyrant-usurper&#x2019; label from the ranks of the Roman senate in the dedication of Constantine&#x2019;s Arch is a good example not only of how Late Roman emperors and their closest advisors created and communicated the imperial image, but also of how other political actors contributed to defining this symbolic sphere of the Roman emperorship.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN080013"><sup>13</sup></xref></p>
<p>From the Constantinian period onwards, <italic>tyrannus</italic> was commonly used to denote political adversaries to the reigning emperor and began to take on new connotations. In outlining the figure of the Good Christian Prince in <italic>Vita Constantini</italic>, Eusebius of Caesarea uses the term <italic>tyrannus</italic> as an antonym for the legitimate and pious ruler. A tyrant is not only one who usurps power through rebellion and oppresses his subjects; anyone who persecutes Christians is a tyrant.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN080014"><sup>14</sup></xref> The problematics presented by these topics are addressed by Escribano&#x2019;s contribution (chapter 7), in which it is shown how this religious meaning of the term is likewise articulated in the political narratives of later Christian emperors. The child emperor Valentinian <sc>II</sc>, persecutor of Nicaeans and protector of Arians, features as a &#x2018;tyrant&#x2019; in a letter (<italic>Collectio Avellana</italic> 39) probably addressed to him by Magnus Maximus because, in the latter&#x2019;s view, Valentinian was interfering in theological issues that were the prerogative of the Church.</p>
<p>However, the values in relation to the representation of the emperor and his power were turned upside down after the reigns of Constantine&#x2019;s sons due to the emergence of another shaping principle: the ideal of the <italic>imitatio deorum</italic> instead of imitating the emperors of the past. In the case of the emperor Julian, this theocratical stance on the image of the emperor and his relation to previous peers, (offered) by Julian himself in <italic>The Caesars</italic>, clashed with the historical view on the same issue defended by his &#x2018;main biographer&#x2019;: Ammianus Marcellinus. The historian&#x2019;s narrative frames Julian&#x2019;s image as a &#x2018;Roman&#x2019; for an elite pagan audience in Rome. Thus, in his contribution, S&#x00E1;nchez-Ostiz (chapter 5) analyses <italic>excursus</italic> in which Ammianus records the reactions of emperors Constantius <sc>II</sc>, Julian, and Jovian to astronomical phenomena. This enquiry highlights how Julian&#x2019;s centrality in Ammianus&#x2019; narrative is figured in contrast to the other emperors: of the three, only Julian is able to overcome his doubts and accept the cosmic warnings, ultimately facing up to a properly Augustan departure from life.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN080015"><sup>15</sup></xref></p>
<p>The following chapters cover the reigns of Jovian, the Valentinians, and Theodosius. Based on previous studies on the iconographic agendas of emperors Constantine and Julian, Fabio Guidetti (chapter 6) examines stylistic strategies reflected in imperial representation in the second half of the fourth century, specifically how the emperors&#x2019; roles were more precisely conceptualised through the representation of their facial features and attributes. Guidetti&#x2019;s analysis of portraits extant from the Valentinian dynasty sheds new light on the multi-faceted self-representation of these emperors, who sought to combine the idealised traits of the Constantinian imperial image with a more effective expression of military strength and readiness for action. On the other hand, the Theodosian style recalls previous classicistic stages in Roman portraiture linked to political messages. Theodosius endeavours to present himself as a true heir to Constantine, and ultimately to Augustus, the founder of the Empire. His portraits, as well as those of his sons, based on a strong classicising ideal including oriental patterns, were also completely absent and motionless, depriving the imperial image of every surviving realistic feature.</p>
<p>In the 370s and the 380s a new understanding of the role and function of a Roman emperor and the Roman monarchy emerged. In this context, Slootjes&#x2019; contribution (chapter 9) deals with an issue that has traditionally been overlooked, namely how changes in the administrative structures of the empire may have functioned as indicators of the emperor&#x2019;s political strategies and his idea of the empire. A comparison between the Verona List (<italic>Laterculus Veronensis</italic>) and the two <italic>Notitiae Dignitatum, Notitia Occidentis</italic> and <italic>Notitiae Orientis</italic>, shows that three major changes were made to the names and territories of dioceses over the course of the fourth century. Notably, all three changes to the dioceses (Aegyptus made independent of the diocese of Oriens, Moesia divided into the dioceses of Dacia and Macedonia, and the dioceses of Galliae and Viennensis merged into one diocese, the so-called <italic>Septem Provinciae</italic>) can be dated to the reign of Theodosius <sc>I</sc>. As emperor, Theodosius did everything in his power to safeguard the political and religious unity of the empire under extraordinary circumstances, endeavouring to integrate all citizens from all regions of the empire. The steps taken to restructure dioceses and prefectures evince his capacity to defend the borders of the empire on an administrative level: accepting the status quo in Aegyptus and Galliae and, for security reasons, reassigning Pannonia to the prefecture of Italy, and Macedonia and Dacia to the prefecture of Illyricum.</p>
<p>And yet, discord and conflicts did not disappear. In the Christianised empire, imperial portraits were still regarded as holy objects, worthy of reverence. Therefore, any attack on the image of the emperor could be interpreted as an attack on the person of the emperor &#x2013; that is, as an act of treason.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN080016"><sup>16</sup></xref> One such attack took place in Antioch in 387, the so-called &#x201C;Riot of the Statues&#x201D;. In response to a considerable rise in taxes, a crowd attacked the palace of the provincial governor pulling down wooden panel pictures with Theodosius&#x2019; portrait and casting down the bronze statues of the imperial family. Quiroga&#x2019;s contribution (chapter 8) explores Theodosius&#x2019; political and emotional responses to the attack in contemporary Christian and pagan sources (John Chrysostom, Ambrose of Milan and Libanius) as well as later historians (Sozomen, Theodoret, and Zosimus). Irrespective of their religious affiliation, all these sources emphasise similar imperial virtues (piety, clemency and philanthropy), which are drawn from the traditional schools of rhetoric. The emperor&#x2019;s wrath is unanimously excused given the magnitude of the offense. However, in the case of Ambrose of Milan and John Chrysostom, the emperor&#x2019;s anger is contextualised within a Christian set of values in which <italic>ira-&#x1F40;&#x03C1;&#x03B3;&#x03AE;</italic> is rendered a desirable emotional state when it leads to the practice of such Christian virtues as repentance and forgiveness.</p>

<title>The Emperor&#x2019;s New Clothes</title>
<p>When reading the famous tale by Hans Christian Andersen in which an emperor was so obsessed with clothes and appareances that he was persuased to wear an invisible dress, one can find some similarities with late antique emperors&#x2019; concern for their image. Their efforts and resources to turn themselves into a symbol of power that could reach all the corners of the Empire were parallel to Andersen&#x2019;s emperor. In this sense, it is not difficult to appreciate the preoccupation that Constantine, Julian, or Theodosius showed when it came to the display of their agendas through texts, laws, coins, and different artistic forms that interact with each other. This is precisely what the contributions to this volume seek to investigate: how to disantagle the complex web of propagandistic formats that converge in the figure of the emperor in order to show how these formats were meant to create an ideological wardrobe at the service of each emperor.</p>

<p>It is not my intention to discuss the vocabulary of usurpation,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100000"><sup>*</sup></xref> nor to investigate the ideology of civil war and its celebration in the fourth century. These topics have been largely explored, especially in recent times, and with splendid results.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100001"><sup>1</sup></xref> The aim of my paper is much more limited: I will browse the surviving evidence for the representation of the internal enemy within public media in imperial Rome; I will consider both the visual and textual elements of such representations, and I will try to consider them in parallel. In the first section, surviving monuments and references to them in literary sources are examined; epigraphic evidence is treated in the second section. At the end of the analysis, I will try to formulate some general considerations that &#x2013; hopefully &#x2013; may complement what has already been accomplished by the other scholars.</p>

<title>Representing Civil Wars</title>
<p>The Arch of Constantine was dedicated to the emperor by the senate and people of Rome in <sc>AD</sc> 315.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100002"><sup>2</sup></xref> Among the manifold features that have caught the attention of scholars dealing with such an intriguing monument, the most striking one, in my eyes, is that this is the first surviving monument explicitly celebrating a victory in a civil war, that of Constantine over Maxentius in 312. It also features Romans killing other Romans. In the panel representing the siege of Verona, Maxentius&#x2019; supporters are virtually identical to their opponents in that their armour and helmets are the same (fig. 1.1a). On the panel depicting the Battle of the Milvian Bridge, the identity of the horsemen being slaughtered by Constantine&#x2019;s troops was by no means equivocal. They were easily recognizable as the mounted guard of the emperor (fig. 1.1b), the same men who had been depicted &#x2013; that time as the heroic side &#x2013; a few years before in another late antique monument, the Arch of Galerius in Thessaloniki.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100003"><sup>3</sup></xref></p>

<p>Surprisingly, this aspect &#x2013; an arch celebrating civil war and showing citizens in the very act of killing each other &#x2013; has been overlooked for a long time.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100004"><sup>4</sup></xref> And yet, the fighting scenes on the Arch are well discernable and crudely realistic; as it has been noted, it seems that they were intentionally conceived and located (providing the onlooker with an ideal viewpoint) in order to create an emotional response. I would add that, from a Roman perspective, they would have been even more disturbing, since the victorious soldiers at the Milvian Bridge were the city&#x2019;s aggressors, whilst its defenders were humiliated. However, this broke with a centuries-old tradition. I believe that, although we cannot exclude that some precedent had existed, the importance and the scale of the Constantinian monument marked a seminal stage.</p>
<p>Ancient authors kept repeating that victory in civil war deserved no celebration, and they reproved any type of commemoration of such achievements. This principle was never really replaced.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100005"><sup>5</sup></xref> It is certain that, during the first three centuries, no proper Roman triumph was ever celebrated for such victories; exceptions are only apparent.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100006"><sup>6</sup></xref> Constantine himself does not seem to have celebrated any actual (technically speaking) &#x2018;triumph&#x2019; for his victories over Maxentius and Licinius.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100007"><sup>7</sup></xref></p>
<p>Triumph apart, behaviour may have been slightly more flexible in reality. Recent research has revealed to what extent the advertisement of success in civil conflicts was crucial for the generals of the later republic. This generated friction between the new needs of the elites and the traditional values and emotions. This problem was overcome through the development of strategies which allowed celebrations of civil war to be incorporated into public commemoration, not only by combining such celebrations with external victories (which provided a cover-up), but also through the creation of memorials and the insertion of dates referring to internal victories in the public calendar, a habit which continues in Late Antiquity.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100008"><sup>8</sup></xref> Celebration, generally speaking, of victories over fellow citizens became somehow possible, but the demarcation line was subtle and seeking celebration for having defeated other Romans was both a delicate and risky undertaking: going too far in this direction could prove politically counterproductive.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100009"><sup>9</sup></xref></p>
<p>Furthermore, in the course of imperial history something may also have changed in the way in which internal conflicts were perceived. While generally admitting that Constantine marked a sort of watershed, scholars, at least since Wickert,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100010"><sup>10</sup></xref> have stressed the importance of the third century for the development of a new political consciousness. Governmental instability and the multiplication of usurpations, generalisation of the citizenship and regionalisation, not least at military level, all contributed to a new definition of civil war, and consequently to a weakening of the resistance to their public celebration.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100011"><sup>11</sup></xref> This is shown, for example, by the display of the rival&#x2019;s decapitated head that was integrated in the &#x2018;Siegesinszenierung.&#x2019;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100012"><sup>12</sup></xref> In such a context, representation of citizens killing each other in civil wars may have appeared less offensive. For that matter, it has been noted that the Roman viewer in 315 was somehow &#x2018;prepared&#x2019; for such an arch through the memory of Maxentius&#x2019; severed head, which had been paraded through the city in 312.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100013"><sup>13</sup></xref> Nevertheless, the display of the mutilated remains of a bad emperor &#x2013; a bad individual &#x2013; is not exactly comparable to the sight of the entire Roman army being butchered and immortalised on a triumphal monument. Representations of slain Romans soldiers may actually have precedents, at least in literature. Wienand has rightly insisted on the remarkable &#x2013; and perhaps unprecedented &#x2013; image of Constantine as offered by his panegyrist of 313, who describes the Roman emperor on the battlefield of Verona, covered with the blood of his (Roman) opponents.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100014"><sup>14</sup></xref> According to Wienand, this image was not an invention of the panegyrist, but had been formed within the entourage of the emperor. Similarly, the representation of killed Roman soldiers on the panels of the arch may have been negotiated by courtiers and representatives of the Roman senate during Constantine&#x2019;s stay in Rome in late 312 and early 313.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100015"><sup>15</sup></xref></p>
<p>Whatever the case may be, it is not easy to find parallels for the Arch in so far as clear visual representations of civil wars are extremely rare, and not only in Roman history. Citizens slaughtering fellow citizens is not a common feature on public memorials (compare for example monuments set up to commemorate episodes of the French revolution, the American, or Spanish civil wars). Celebrations of such events are mostly symbolic or &#x2013; in more recent times &#x2013; focus on the victims, and on the sacrifice of the soldier. Rather than on winning, the emphasis is on a newfound civic concord.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Arch of Constantine may not have been the first large monument to show citizens fighting each other. However, the only known precedent is dated several centuries before. The Julio-Claudian Medinaceli reliefs still await proper publication and remain unfamiliar to historians.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100016"><sup>16</sup></xref> These reliefs &#x2013; originally belonging to a monument located in some Campanian city (perhaps Nola or Puteoli) and now scattered between different locations in Spain and Hungary &#x2013; were for the first time assembled and exhibited at the &#x2018;Mostra augustea&#x2019; in Rome in 2013. The slabs 2, 3 and 4 represent the Battle of Actium, the victory over Cleopatra and Marcus Antonius which was celebrated in the triple triumph of 29 <sc>BC</sc>. The battle was presented as an external victory, or a &#x2018;mixed&#x2019; one,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100017"><sup>17</sup></xref> but here the combatants are barely distinguishable. On the basis of comparison with some sculptural fragments from the Palatine Hill, it has been argued that the Campanian monument was in fact a replica of an urban one.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100018"><sup>18</sup></xref> However, there is no certainty as to its original location or to its visibility.</p>
<p>As far as Rome is concerned, there would not appear to be anything before the end of the third century. The possibility that the tetrarchic <italic>Arcus Novus</italic> in Rome had celebrated, and depicted, the victory over the British usurpers has been argued on purely hypothetical grounds.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100019"><sup>19</sup></xref> If we want to find some concrete evidence we have to move on again to the Constantinian age. The picturesque tower, on the 19th kilometre of the Via Flaminia, known as the Arco di Malborghetto is in fact an arch. Its masonry shows some characteristic late features. T&#x00F6;belmann (1915) was the first to suggest that this arch was erected on the very place where the Constantinian army had set up its camp before the Battle of the Milvian Bridge. This assumption, both plausible and very intriguing, has gained a wide following (fig. 1.2).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100020"><sup>20</sup></xref> This would be another arch for the Constantinian victory over Maxentius, but unfortunately no sculptural or epigraphic evidence related to it survives.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100021"><sup>21</sup></xref> Ammianus (21, 16, 5)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100022"><sup>22</sup></xref> narrates that Constantius <sc>II</sc> had some arches erected in Gallia and Pannonia after his victory over the usurper Magnentius in 352&#x2013;353, but not one has been securely identified.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100023"><sup>23</sup></xref></p>

<p>The remains of the Arch of Janus in the Forum Boarium have been recently re-examined and new evidence has been discovered. This allows us to date it to the post-Constantinian period and reinforces the hypothesis that it was erected to commemorate Constantius <sc>II</sc>&#x2019;s victory in civil wars. However, this arch does not appear to have included reliefs depicting war scenes (fig. 1.3).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100024"><sup>24</sup></xref></p>

<p>A long passage in the panegyric of Pacatus to Theodosius &#x2013; recited in Rome in 389 &#x2013; implies that there were, or that there should have been, depictions of Maximus humiliated after having been defeated by the emperor.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100025"><sup>25</sup></xref> An arch was set up to celebrate Honorius&#x2019; victory over the usurper Gildo in the Roman Forum.

<p>The Theodosian period provides us with more tangible evidence, in particular in Constantinople.

<p>Our evidence thus appears to be concentrated both in space and time; Rome in Constantinian times and, perhaps, Constantinople in Theodosian. Here, large imperial monuments offered realistic representations of civil wars, and such representations were created in the tradition of the Roman relief, embedded in a traditional monumental medium. Was victory in civil wars commemorated in other ways? Was it expressed through other mediums?</p>
<p>Eusebius records that Constantine had a painting set over the magnificent entrance of his new palace in Constantinople: &#x201C;it showed the Saviour&#x2019;s sign placed above his own head, and the hostile and inimical beast, which had laid siege to the Church of God through the tyranny of the godless, he made in the form of a dragon borne down to the deep &#x2026; pierced through the middle of the body with a javelin &#x2026;&#x201D;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100031"><sup>31</sup></xref> (fig. 1.6 displays a hypothetical reconstruction of the painting).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100032"><sup>32</sup></xref> The snake represents the forces of evil &#x2013; political and religious evil &#x2013; embodied in the person of the usurper. Constantine himself gives support to this interpretation when, in one of his letters, he unambiguously defines his rival Licinius, as the &#x201C;dragon&#x201D; (<italic>VC</italic> 2 46, 2: &#x201C;but now, with liberty restored and that dragon driven out of the public administration through the providence of the supreme God and by our service &#x2026;&#x201D;).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100033"><sup>33</sup></xref> It is uncertain whether this scene is borrowed from Christian iconography with the image of Christ treading on a lion and a snake (Psalm 91: 13: &#x201C;&#x2026; the young lion and the serpent you will trample underfoot&#x201D;), or rather from the traditional scene of <italic>calcatio colli</italic>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100034"><sup>34</sup></xref> One would expect to find more allegorical representations of the usurper, but the evidence is disappointingly poor.</p>

<p>These types remain isolated, but reappear in the highly standardised monetary iconography of the fifth century. From the 420s onwards, depictions of the emperor placing his right foot over a human-headed snake are frequently encountered, for example, the solidus of Valentinian <sc>III</sc> struck in 425&#x2013;426 (fig. 1.8). It has been argued, on the basis of the fourth century example of Constantius <sc>II</sc>, that this was an allusion to the downfall of the usurper Johannes. Emperors trampling on an enemy was a rather frequent iconographic motif; here the downtrodden barbarian is, supposedly, replaced by a symbolic image of the internal enemy.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100038"><sup>38</sup></xref> The eventual and large dissemination of this type of coin suggests that the specific connection with usurpers (if there had been one) was quickly forgotten.</p>

<p>It is almost superfluous to add &#x2013; or indeed stress &#x2013; that coin legends from the fourth and fifth centuries contain no direct reference to victory in civil wars. There is no coin proclaiming the emperor as e.g. <italic>exctinctor tyrannorum</italic>. There are more allusive slogans which can be connected to victory in a civil war, such as those referring to the <italic>restitutio</italic>, the <italic>securitas publica</italic> &#x2026; But this is obviously not the same thing. It must be said that reference to specific victories, rather common in the early empire (for example <italic>Germania devicta</italic>), disappear from coins after the 330s; from this point onwards, legends tend to celebrate the victorious emperor, rather than his single achievements.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100039"><sup>39</sup></xref> That said, barbarians and prostrate captives are commonly depicted. In any case, even in the aforementioned examples, the legends are elusive: the Constantinian coin calls upon the SPES PVBLIC(A), one of Constantius <sc>II</sc> styles him as DEBELLATOR HOSTIVM, while the fifth century type carries just VICTORIA AVGG.</p>
<p>In summary, evidence for parallels of the representations on the Arch of Constantine is meagre outside Rome and Constantinople. In addition, none of the monuments in the two capitals seem to have been celebrating only victories in civil war. The figurative program of the Arch of Constantine refers or alludes to the external victories of the emperor through images of barbarian captives, and the same thing can be said about the two Constantinopolitan columns. Byzantine sources referring to Theodosius&#x2019; column concur, and the reliefs of the Column of Arcadius, if they really do represent barbarians as part of the civil war &#x2013; are clearly recognisable. In the coinage, victory over the usurper, unlike victory over barbarians or victory <italic>tout court</italic>, is simply not a possible theme, and its eventual symbolic representation, not more than an ambiguous allusion, had but a feeble echo.</p>

<p>The urban arch possesses another &#x2018;novelty&#x2019;, this time in its inscription: the term <italic>tyrannus</italic> used to designate the political rival, the usurper. This term, or rather a concept, was destined to have great importance in the fourth century and beyond. The whole text is provided in Appendix n. 5, but I will focus on this title.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100040"><sup>40</sup></xref> Our evidence about this particular use of <italic>tyrannus</italic> &#x2013; thanks to the discovery of new inscriptions &#x2013; is now richer than a few years ago and is worth reconsidering. The dissemination of <italic>tyrannus</italic> through epigraphic records can help us to understand the features that emerge from the above discussion.</p>
<p>The Greek term <italic>tyrannos</italic> was introduced in Rome early on and originally meant no more than &#x2018;king&#x2019;. For most Romans the words <italic>tyrannus</italic> and <italic>rex</italic> remained synonyms. It was under the influence of Greek philosophy and rhetoric that the noun <italic>tyrannus</italic> came into use also for denoting a bad sovereign.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100041"><sup>41</sup></xref> In Roman political oratory, <italic>tyrannus</italic> is the counterpart of the good leader; an archetypical character, the embodiment of vice with no virtue, driven by cruelty and self-interest, an avatar of bad rule. More generally, it is a label for anyone who acts in a despotic way, who abuses his power, for example Verres, Antonius, Catilina &#x2026;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100042"><sup>42</sup></xref> In literature and historiography, authors could use it to condemn emperors, whether struck by <italic>damnatio memoriae</italic> or not.</p>
<p>Before Constantine, in official documents or inscriptions, <italic>tyrannus</italic> had never been used for designating political adversaries of the reigning emperor.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100043"><sup>43</sup></xref> This point deserves to be stressed: the term <italic>tyrannus</italic> was introduced under Constantine. As already noted,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100044"><sup>44</sup></xref> this would appear to have been, at the latest, after his victorious entry into Rome in 312. It may have been disseminated through official documents in late 312 or 313.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100045"><sup>45</sup></xref> Two laws abolishing acts of the <italic>tyrannus</italic> were promulgated by Constantine in 313, a third one in 314.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100046"><sup>46</sup></xref> We do not know when the anniversary of <italic>evictio tyranni</italic> on October 28 was introduced in the Roman calendar (it appears only in that of Philocalus), but it is reasonable to believe that this occurred shortly after the defeat of Maxentius.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100047"><sup>47</sup></xref></p>
<p>Driven by the use made in documents issued by the court, the label <italic>tyrannus</italic> quickly began to circulate. In the panegyric of Constantine recited in 313, Maxentius is never called tyrant,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100048"><sup>48</sup></xref> and Lactantius, who writes sometime after 313, does not seem to be aware of the new political meaning of this word. On the other hand, Eusebius uses it extensively in the section of his <italic>Historia</italic> which would appear to have been written after Constantine&#x2019;s victory. It may be that such a particular use of the word had come to Eusebius&#x2019; attention through the reading of imperial letters, since he states that Maximinus, who died in the summer of 313, was the first to be &#x201C;posted in public edits on tablets as the most hateful and God-hating tyrant.&#x201D;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100049"><sup>49</sup></xref> Eventually, it becomes very frequent. Nazarius, in his panegyric to Constantine produced in 321, is patently familiar with this concept. Occurrences are countless and it would be of no use to cite them all. In laws and official acts emanating from court or other administrative offices, <italic>tyrannus</italic> is the common title for a usurper. It is prevalent in panegyrics and eulogistic prose or poetry (such as Optatianus Porphyrius&#x2019; poems); it can be found in petitions addressed to the emperors or to his representatives (such as the pamphlet <italic>De rebus bellicis</italic>). This did not prevent authors of the fourth century from continuing to make a more traditional use of the word <italic>tyrannus</italic>: Victor, Eutropius and other epitomisers apply the label <italic>tyrannus</italic> to those whom they judge to be bad princes, no matter if they were struck by <italic>damnatio memoriae</italic>, or styled <italic>tyranni</italic> by their rivals. Ammianus employs the word (in this specific political meaning) parsimoniously: in two cases, he evokes the <italic>tyranni</italic> (Silvanus and Maximus),<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100050"><sup>50</sup></xref> while the noun <italic>tyrannus</italic> appears only in one speech by Constantius <sc>II</sc> (15, 8, 6: <italic>rebelles tyranni</italic>) and in the transcription of the letter by the same Constantius to Shapur (17, 5, 13). At the end of the century, the <italic>Historia Augusta</italic> provides a purely pragmatic definition of the concept: it is the fact of being conquered by their adversaries that turns some emperors into tyrants: <italic>quos tyrannos aliorum victoria fecit</italic>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100051"><sup>51</sup></xref></p>
<p>A study of the epigraphic occurrences of <italic>tyrannus</italic> is useful. These are collated in the Appendix at the end of this chapter. They are only in Latin and there is nothing comparable in Greek epigraphy. I will not discuss every single document, but I will highlight those which are particularly significant, and try to draw some conclusions from the typology and provenance of the occurrences.</p>
<p>None of the inscriptions predate Constantine (in number 0 the word <italic>tyrannus</italic> was restored by Mommsen). The earliest texts are approximately contemporary with the appearance of this concept in a juridical text (the two laws previously quoted). In effect, though the first surely dated example comes from the Arch in 315 (text no. 5), this was almost certainly not the earliest. One recently discovered stone from Thugga in Africa Proconsularis has been dated convincingly to 313 (text no. 3).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100052"><sup>52</sup></xref> Here, Constantine is acclaimed as <italic>[domitor? ty]rannicae factionis</italic>. The presence of the word <italic>factio</italic>,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100053"><sup>53</sup></xref> which also appears in the arch inscription, is noteworthy. A parallel celebration of Constantine, with <italic>factio</italic> but without the word <italic>tyrannus</italic>, can be found in a couple of inscriptions erected in Cirta, Numidia between 312 and 315. These honour the emperor as &#x201C;the one who <italic>triumphs</italic> over all the (barbarian) nations and <italic>conquers</italic> every faction, who through his victory, restored freedom, which was oppressed by the darkness of slavery&#x201D; (<italic>triumphator omnium gentium ac domitor universarum factionum, qui libertatem tenebris servitutis oppressam sua felici victoria nova inluminavit</italic>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100054"><sup>54</sup></xref> This proves that this specific rhetorical imagery &#x2013; the language employed to portray Constantine as a <italic>liberator</italic> &#x2013; travelled speedily and was acknowledged in Africa very soon after his victory.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100055"><sup>55</sup></xref></p>
<p>Eusebius states that Constantine, shortly after his arrival in Rome in 312, had a statue erected in the &#x201C;most crowded place&#x201D; of the capital &#x2013; supposedly the Forum &#x2013; showing himself with the &#x2018;salvific sign&#x2019; in his hand. Eusebius provides a precise transcription of the text carved on the base; here Constantine, talking in the first person, described himself as the liberator of the city from the &#x2018;yoke of the tyrant&#x2019; (text no. 2a). I dare not even touch on the problem of the identification of this statue or of the sign, issues on which there have been endless discussions.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100056"><sup>56</sup></xref> I agree with those who think that we should not doubt the existence of such a monument. It is unlikely that Eusebius simply fabricated it.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100057"><sup>57</sup></xref> Although I do not deny that this is a very odd text (if style and language are suitable to an epigraphic honour, a self-dedication is not common), we must accept that there was some kind of statuary monument, clearly visible in Rome, in which Constantine was presented as a <italic>liberator</italic> from the tyrant&#x2019;s despotic rule.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100058"><sup>58</sup></xref> Numbers 4 and 7, both from the Forum area, may also be connected to Constantine. Concerning no. 4, it must be stressed that the original inscription, carved on a marble slab, measured no less than three meters in length; no doubt it belonged to a large honorific monument, perhaps the pedestal of a statuary group. The surviving letters <italic>TAE</italic> on the second line have been recognised &#x2013; in my opinion correctly &#x2013; as part of the adjective <italic>taeterrimus o taeter</italic>, very appropriate to qualify tyrants (actual parallels do exist). The plural form (<italic>liberatoribus</italic>) is also notable. It may refer to Constantine and Licinius and would show that Constantine&#x2019;s colleague was also praised for his activity against tyrants (thus confirming Eusebius&#x2019; statement according to which Maximinus was styled <italic>tyrannus</italic> in Licinius&#x2019; official acts). Number 7 has been assigned to Constantine on palaeographical data (the lettering best fits with the first half of fourth century), but it may also refer to some of his successors. What is quite interesting here is the fact that internal victories are coupled with victory over barbarians, and the former precede the latter; victory in civil war has been given priority. The presence of <italic>ex(s)tinctor</italic> is also remarkable; the link between the verb <italic>exstinguere</italic> and civil wars is ancient and recalls Augustus&#x2019; claim of having &#x2018;extinguished&#x2019; <italic>bella civilia</italic>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100059"><sup>59</sup></xref></p>
<p>The vocabulary of <italic>tyrannus</italic> was inherited and enhanced by the son of Constantine, Constantius <sc>II</sc>, who conquered Magnentius and Vetranio; we find it used both in literature and in epigraphy. On the inscription engraved on the equestrian statue set up by the urban prefect in the Forum, near to the Arch of Severus, the emperor is styled <italic>exctinctor pestiferae tyrannidis</italic>, &#x201C;the one who abolishes the ruinous tyranny&#x201D; (text no. 8). Additionally, according to a recent suggestion, Constantius <sc>II</sc> could have been characterised as the <italic>superb[i tyranni factionis extinct]or</italic> on the &#x2018;Arch of Janus&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100060"><sup>60</sup></xref> The slogan <italic>extinctor tyrannorum</italic> was exploited for successive emperors. Three statues of Valentinian <sc>II</sc>, Theodosius and Arcadius were erected in the area of <italic>Comitium</italic> at the end of the year 388 by the urban prefect (texts no. 11&#x2013;13), their dedicatory inscriptions hail them with the title of <italic>extinctores tyrannorum</italic>. The same formula can be found on the base of the Theodosian obelisk in Constantinople (text no. 15). Another large monument, around three meters in length, was dedicated again to Valentinian <sc>II</sc>, Theodosius and Arcadius, once again in the statue-crowded <italic>Comitium</italic> area, and it mentions the <italic>[saevoru]m tyranno[r]um domination[em - - -]</italic> (text no. 14).</p>
<p>The two obelisks of Rome and Constantinople, erected in 357 by Constantius <sc>II</sc> and in 390 by Theodosius (conquerors of Magnentius and Maximus), respectively, are sometimes said to be strictly linked to the celebration of internal victories. Actually both dedicatory inscriptions allude to the victory over a tyrant. Nevertheless, this feature is less important than the exaltation of the prince capable of the enterprise of setting up a huge monolithic stone (compare texts no. 10<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100061"><sup>61</sup></xref> and 15). The monuments themselves contain no allusion to the tyrants&#x2019; fate; they are just obelisks.</p>
<p>Once again to summarise, all these inscriptions are public in character. They were commissioned by civic authorities or by the city as a whole, and engraved upon stones intended to be displayed in a public place. The exception is one epitaph of Sidonius&#x2019; grandfather, which is very late and known only indirectly (no. 18). Also, in non-imperial dedications the use of the term is strictly official, for instance, reference to the activity of an officer during the usurper&#x2019;s reign (no. 6, 21; cf. 17). Most of these inscriptions are honorary; in other words they represent the textual ingredient of more complex honorific monuments, such as pedestrian or equestrian statues, or statuary groups. Some of them appear to have been of considerable size. Unfortunately, we do not know what the statues looked like, apart from the one described by Eusebius. It is possible that the sculptural element of these monuments contained a more or less symbolic reference of the defeated tyrant.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100062"><sup>62</sup></xref> One might, for example, wonder if under the horse of Constantius there was not a snake, exactly as in the coin.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100063"><sup>63</sup></xref></p>
<p>Almost all of these inscriptions come from Rome. In Constantinople, where there are fewer examples, the word <italic>tyrannus</italic> only appears in a couple of inscriptions that commemorate public buildings, but this may be due to the fact we do not possess much of the city&#x2019;s epigraphy. There are two texts from Africa, one from Lavinium, another from Atina, and one from Syracuse. Both African texts refer most likely to statues (no. 3 to Constantine; no. 1 uncertain, under Constantine), as well as the two Italian inscriptions (text no. 6, from Atina is a dedication to a senator who held an imperial office during the <italic>saevissima tyrannis</italic> of Maxentius; text no. 21, from Lavinium, is a dedication to Constantine or Constantius <sc>II</sc>, who had restored the city from the famine which occurred <italic>temporibus tyran[ni]</italic>); the honorary nature of the inscription from Syracuse seems also clear (text no. 20).</p>
<p>The strong concentration of inscriptions in Rome, particularly in front of the Senate-house, is impressive. The Roman honorary inscriptions, including the Arch of Constantine, were dedicated to emperors who visited the capital after having conquered their internal enemies, in some cases in close connection with their <italic>adventus</italic> (Constantine visited Rome in 312, 315 and 321; Constantius in 357; Theodosius in June 389; and the prefect Albinus (awarder of no. 11&#x2013;13) was in office from that same June 389 until February 391). The connection between these monuments and the actual presence of the rulers also appears significant considering that they stood in places where the emperors had, or were expected, to stop, and could therefore see them. It was exactly in this corner of the Forum that the imperial procession through the city came to an end under Christian emperors (no ascent to the Capitol was performed after Constantine); the sovereign addressed a speech to the senate in the Senate-house and was welcomed by the people whilst standing upon the <italic>rostra</italic>, before withdrawing to the palace on the Palatine hill.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100064"><sup>64</sup></xref></p>
<p>In other words, the collection of <italic>tyrannus</italic>-inscriptions shows that the reference to the internal enemy as the reason for acclaiming the emperor was scarcely employed outside Rome, where it seems to concentrate in a very special area, the open space in front of the curia, that became the centre for imperial celebration in the capital from Diocletian onwards. Here, the Romans (the Roman senators) erected several monuments that praised the rulers as victors of civil war, as liberators of tyranny, as <italic>restitutores</italic> of the City, of the &#x2018;Roman name&#x2019;, and of the righteous rule (all of which indirectly represented a claim of the centrality of Rome and of its prerogative of bestowing imperial power).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100065"><sup>65</sup></xref> In other regions of the empire people did not feel the same need to express their loyalty through reference to civil war. It cannot be a coincidence that, despite the large circulation of the rhetoric of <italic>tyranni</italic> (in eulogy and in official documents), and the survival of the statuary habit for the whole fourth century in many regions (such as peninsular Italy or the provinces of northern Africa), the inscriptions celebrating emperors for the victory over <italic>tyranni</italic> are virtually non-existent outside Rome. Epigraphic and figurative evidence would thus seem to go hand in hand, indicating that the monumental celebration of victory in internal conflicts was a phenomenon that was confined to the centres of power, namely Rome, at least as far as concerns its monuments, but also Constantinople, whose surviving epigraphy is perhaps not representative.</p>

<title>Good and Bad Rulers</title>
<p>This brings us to the third and final part of the study. Here, a few general remarks about the introduction of the concept of <italic>tyrannus</italic>, its political implications and the limits of its use in public monuments, ought to be made.</p>
<p>In earlier times, and in fact until the time of the tetrarchs, the enemy within was referred to in various ways. He was either unnamed, or could be styled <italic>hostis publicus</italic>, a formal definition which followed a declaration by the senate (the first occurrence is under Nero, but was still in use in the fourth century).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100066"><sup>66</sup></xref> He could additionally be alluded to as <italic>rebellis</italic> or <italic>latro</italic> (both also in official documents), pirate, barbarian. This was still the case under the tetrarchs, whose panegyrists speak of British usurpers as pirates and robbers.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100067"><sup>67</sup></xref></p>
<p>Since it seems that it was decided, in a precise moment around 312 to label Maxentius a <italic>tyrannus</italic>, the first questions are: why this particular name and what was its inspiration? In 1990 Thomas Grunewald devoted many pages of his book on Constantinian propaganda to the discussion of <italic>tyrannus</italic>, as a political &#x2018;Schlagwort&#x2019;, in imperial ideology, but offered no real explanation for its origin. A few years later, Timothy Barnes tried to answer the question. Observing that already by the third century Christian authors, (Tertullian and Cyprian), employed the word <italic>tyrannus</italic> to signify the persecutor, Barnes argued that Constantine had this specific meaning in mind and consciously selected it to advertise his sympathies, to proclaim that he was there to protect the Christians against their oppressors.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100068"><sup>68</sup></xref> I am not convinced by this explanation, and would rather attribute the choice to other, more secular issues. In particular, I find it easier to believe that <italic>tyrannus</italic> had been chosen, drawing on the rhetoric and literary tradition, since it was more suitable to keeping with the actual situation in which the emperor Constantine found himself at the beginning of his rule.</p>
<p>Firstly, Constantine was no doubt the cause of the success of this word, but not necessarily its &#x2018;inventor.&#x2019; The inscription of the Arch, as it has been convincingly shown, is a senatorial creation. It contains clear allusions to classical authors who narrate the history of the ancient history of the city; the &#x201C;inspiration of the deity&#x201D; seems to recall Livy&#x2019;s account of Camillus&#x2019; assault on Veii, which perhaps was combined with an allusion to the overthrow of the Tarquinii.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100069"><sup>69</sup></xref> We have seen that some elements which are present in the vocabulary of the Arch already circulated immediately after the victory at the Milvian Bridge. In particular, the theme of liberation from the <italic>tyrannus</italic> and his <italic>factio</italic> are found in documents dating back to <italic>before</italic> 315 (the inscriptions from Cirta). This means, in my opinion, that such an imagery or at least its initial nucleus was created in the aftermath of the defeat of Maxentius. There are good reasons to think that this occurred in Rome. Rather than envisaging a propagandistic message negotiated between the senate and the emperor, I would at least consider the possibility that this imagery was created outside the court circle and was presented (for example, through panegyrics commissioned by the Roman senators) to the emperor, who appreciated it and decided to make it his own.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100070"><sup>70</sup></xref> The word <italic>tyrannus</italic> may have been one of the ingredients of the original portrait offered to the emperor, which fused episodes of the ancient history of Rome, the <italic>evocatio</italic> and the end of the tyrants. The incorporation of the word in such a picture was entirely natural; Superbus was &#x201C;the exemplum <italic>par excellence</italic> in Rome of a tyrant.&#x201D;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100071"><sup>71</sup></xref> <italic>Tyrannus</italic> may even have been used before in connection to a usurper, though there is no trace of this. That said, in the coherent imagery created in 312/313, such a title found a consistent and effective place.</p>
<p>Whoever invented and employed it, whether it was Constantine himself, or someone from his entourage, it was a brilliant idea. It suited both the elite of ancient Rome and the emperor, much better than previously used definitions. Maxentius was not recognised by his colleagues,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100072"><sup>72</sup></xref> but he had been recognised by the senate<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100073"><sup>73</sup></xref> and he had been ruling from Rome, the &#x201C;seat of power,&#x201D; not from some remote province (like the &#x2018;robbers&#x2019; of <italic>Imperium Galliarum</italic>, the &#x2018;pirates&#x2019; of Britain &#x2026;).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100074"><sup>74</sup></xref> Maxentius was, after all, the first emperor reigning in Rome to be stripped of his title in a very long time. His hereditary rights were even stronger than those of his rivals: the son of Maximinian, who had been Augustus since 285, and of Caesar Galerius&#x2019; daughter, Maxentius could be considered in some way superior to the fruit of the first marriage of Caesar Constantius to a humble woman. Maxentius had soon recognised the title of Augustus which his father had conferred to Constantine in late summer 307. All of this made him a particularly insidious and embarrassing enemy for Constantine, who claimed the right to the throne on the basis of his hereditary titles (son of Constantius and, from 310, descendant of Claudius).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100075"><sup>75</sup></xref> By associating the actors of civil war with certain historical figures (the tyrant Tarquinius and Camillus), a nobler picture of the clash between the two tetrarchs<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100076"><sup>76</sup></xref> could be conjured up, which suited both Constantine and the senators quite well.</p>
<p>But there are more elements which can probably explain the success of <italic>tyrannus</italic>. Whatever the origin or whoever the &#x2018;inventor&#x2019; of the word was, with Constantine styling his rivals <italic>tyranni</italic> (or welcoming and disseminating such a representation), a step forward in political ideology was taken. The creators of this new ideal persona may or may not have been conscious of the consequences of its introduction, but these consequences soon became evident and no doubt contributed to its eventual success.</p>
<p>As we have seen, before Constantine the enemy within was referred to as <italic>hostis</italic>, as <italic>rebellis</italic> or <italic>latro</italic>, including in official documents, or pirate, or barbarian. That is to say, the enemy was projected <italic>outside</italic> the Roman orbit (<italic>hostis, barbarus</italic>), or to its edges (robber or pirate). The latter definitions (thief, robber, pirate, but also barbarian) also contain the idea of social distance and contempt; the good emperor and his rivals are not on the same level.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100077"><sup>77</sup></xref> The transfer of the old stereotypical character of the <italic>tyrannus</italic> into the real historical scenario and into the official language spawned a new category within Roman imperial politics. The internal enemy obtained the status of a new performer in public life and, at the same time, the emperor came to define his own power in a more explicit way. <italic>Tyrannus</italic> is not an external enemy, nor a robber, he is just somebody who rules badly. The constitutional basis of his power is not questioned by such a definition. The term <italic>tyrannus</italic> emphasises moral indignity, egoistic aims, cruelty etc. rather than legitimacy, at least not directly (legitimacy itself is a weak concept for the ancients).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100078"><sup>78</sup></xref> One can still be a <italic>tyrannus</italic>, and yet be perfectly Roman, possessing various claims to the throne, such as hereditary rights, formal senatorial recognition and so on. At the same time, the official recognition of the existence of <italic>tyrannus</italic> indirectly defined the emperor as a king, since the tyrant is its opposite, its specular antithesis. As Cicero reminds us in his <italic>De re publica</italic> (drawing on the Aristotelian-Polybian formulation of the three forms of government), tyranny is the degeneration of the monarchy, and fourth century authors repeat that tyranny and kingship are twins. Every ruler is at risk of transforming himself into a tyrant<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100079"><sup>79</sup></xref> and tyrannical attitudes in an emperor can always be corrected by another.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100080"><sup>80</sup></xref> By admitting the existence of bad kings, what all previous emperors had refused to confess overtly was acknowledged; that there could be more than one emperor (that is, a multiplicity of emperors ruling without mutual recognition, without <italic>concordia</italic>), and that there could be real civil wars. There should be wars as the good emperor had the responsibility to eliminate the bad one in order to restore a righteous rule. This was an actually moral <italic>duty</italic> for every citizen, as theorised for a very long time; Cicero asserts that aspiring to tyranny, to <italic>regnum</italic> or <italic>dominatio</italic> legitimises preventive tyrannicide.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100081"><sup>81</sup></xref> Ideally, the bad ruler had to perish in the most atrocious and spectacular way, in order to expiate through his body the suffering inflicted on others,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100082"><sup>82</sup></xref> while the good one deserved general gratitude and public recognition, since he acted for the salvation of all.</p>
<p>Much of this was not new in itself, but it was new in political communication. The acceptance of such a conception was also easier during (and more suitable to) the reign of Constantine for another reason. Since well before Constantine, new theologies of imperial power had coupled and challenged (though not replaced) the old Roman principles according to which the emperor rules on behalf of the Roman people (Rome is the real owner of power; emperors are just temporary agents). From the third century there is a growing insistence on the fact that the real source of the emperor&#x2019;s power is divine will. That was, at least, what emperors claimed, for example Aurelian, who warned the mutinous troops that it was God, not the soldiers, who bestowed the purple.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100083"><sup>83</sup></xref> The tetrarchic system was based on a tenaciously advertised political theology. Constantine&#x2019;s fervent monotheism did nothing but reinforce this belief. People could now think, or were invited to think, that a superior and unappealable entity, which was neither the senate, nor other emperors, nor the troops, had the right to decide who had the right to rule, and who were the good and the bad.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100084"><sup>84</sup></xref> Chosen and inspired by his God, as in a pious mission, the good emperor takes action against the enemies of the heavenly master and of his fellow human beings, the <italic>tyranni</italic>, and there was no risk of being wrong.</p>
<p>When Constantine came to power, times were ready for accepting a <italic>tyrannus</italic>. The introduction of <italic>tyrannus</italic> was astute; the word proved a useful and flexible instrument for Constantine himself and for the following emperors. After being widely exploited for Maxentius, it was later easily and naturally applied to other usurpers with only the necessary adjustments. It provided a comfortable solution for justifying civil wars, sweeping away embarrassment; it was a useful tool for affirming one&#x2019;s right to rule. But celebration of the victory over a <italic>tyrannus</italic>, also proposed under Constantine, continued to encounter opposition in the Roman Empire. To accept the existence of <italic>tyranni</italic> did not imply the approval of the celebration of victories obtained &#x201C;out of Roman blood,&#x201D; <italic>ex sanguine Romano</italic>. The main problem was this, that eliminating the villain and the malicious members of his entourage (his <italic>factio</italic>), did not justify killing all Romans who had followed him. Most people considered that, after all, civil wars were a personal business. Ammianus relates that Valentinian declined to give help to his brother against the usurper Procopius, preferring to use his army against barbarians, claiming that &#x201C;Procopius was only his own and his brother&#x2019;s enemy, but the Alamanni were the enemies of the whole Roman world&#x201D; (26, 5, 13).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100085"><sup>85</sup></xref></p>
<p>Despite what has been said by certain authors,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100086"><sup>86</sup></xref> our sources show that resistance to celebrations for internal victories remained strong, and it would be a mistake to discard the explicit and unequivocal statements of Ammianus, Proba and Claudian, labelling them as the old-fashioned criticisms by a reactionary minority.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100087"><sup>87</sup></xref> The difficulty people had in accepting the celebration of victories in internal conflicts by merely declaring the internal enemy a <italic>tyrannus</italic>, is shown by the fact that even in panegyrics that call the <italic>tyrant</italic> with this name, the latter continues to be depicted also through the old devices; he is dressed in the clothes of a barbarian and/or a robber. Julian praises Constantius <sc>II</sc> for his victory over Magnentius in the great battle of Mursa, but specifies that Magnentius&#x2019; army could not be considered a Roman one, and while still calling Magnentius <italic>tyrannus</italic>, he portrays him as a barbarian (actually he says that he <italic>was</italic> a barbarian).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100088"><sup>88</sup></xref> The same characterisation can be found in Themistius&#x2019; speeches to Constantius <sc>II</sc> (<italic>Or</italic>. 2 33d; 3 43a etc.); both authors clearly state that a war against such a feral and brutish individual did not deserve the appellation of civil war. Even Pacatus, who seems otherwise perfectly at ease with the idea of civil war celebration (<italic>Pan. Lat</italic>. <sc>II</sc>(12) 46, 4), depicts Theodosius&#x2019; enemies in the same manner, especially when he states that Romans who had chosen to fight for the tyrant were no longer Romans.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100089"><sup>89</sup></xref></p>
<p>We have observed that also in monuments commemorating civil conflicts the figurative representations of Roman wars were accompanied by clear references to external wars, wars against barbarians. It seems like there was still a will to dilute the disruptive force of such a vision (Romans killing Romans) by inserting it in the more reassuring framework of imperial victory.</p>
<p>Constantine succeeded perhaps in creating a new conception of the way power could be legitimated, but neither he nor his successors in the fourth century could win the force of tradition, and the human, anthropological commiseration of the war between fellow citizens. The result was a compromise. This compromise contributed to shape the political history and imperial ideology of Late Antiquity and beyond.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN100090"><sup>90</sup></xref></p>

<p>Take for example &#x2013; in the same period &#x2013; the case of the &#x2018;disguised&#x2019; triumph of Aurelian over Tetricus: according to <italic>HA Aur</italic>. 34, 2 Tetricus was brought in triumph <italic>clamide coccea, tunica galbina, bracis Gallicis ornatus</italic> (that is: he was clothed as a barbarian enemy; see Mayer 2002, 160).

Wickert (1954, 2123) while admitting that the word does not appear before Constantine, thinks that it may have developed during the third century, when the emperors were no longer content to stigmatize the &#x2018;Gegenkaiser&#x2019; as illegitimate, but also to brand him as a &#x2018;Gewaltherrscher&#x2019;.

<p>The imperial portrait &#x2013; as we know it through panegyrics, inscriptions, and documents &#x2013; is often the result of an interaction between centre and periphery: in some cases the interaction can work in a bottom-up sense; someone, from outside the court, proposes images that are accepted by the court and broadcasted.</p>

<title>Introduction<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110000"><sup>*</sup></xref></title>
<p>The Arch of Constantine is a spectacular monument embedded in a densely developed urban landscape, situated at the foot of the north-eastern slopes of the Palatine Hill, at the entrance to the Forum Romanum&#x2019;s Sacred Way. Its design and the different stages of construction, as well as the spatial and societal context, cause problems in interpretation for which many solutions have been proposed. In recent decades, scholars, if not focusing on the building process, tend to judge the Arch on the basis of its iconographic program, e.g. by distilling a meaning from the use of <italic>spolia</italic> in its design. While archaeological and art-historical excavations have studied the building process and sculptural programme, this chapter will depart from previous works on the Arch in its historical context, providing some new approaches for its architectural forms and inscriptions.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110001"><sup>1</sup></xref> As a triumphal monument, dedicated by the senate in Rome, it celebrated a recently arrived victorious ruler after the defeat of an enemy.</p>
<p>The historical context can be reconstructed by tracing the genesis of the Arch, mapping its physical surroundings and comparing it to similar monuments of earlier date.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110002"><sup>2</sup></xref> The point of departure is the Arch as a triumphal monument, to be compared with its textual counterpart of panegyric. In fact, the panegyric from the year <sc>AD</sc> 321 (<italic>Pan. Lat.</italic> <sc>IV</sc>[10]), equally in honour of the victorious emperor Constantine, was supposedly delivered only a few yards away from the newly erected triumphal Arch &#x2013; the orator, Nazarius by name, could indicate it by gesture. As for other textual sources, such as inscriptions and juridical texts, I will argue that only few of them may be used to shed light on building practices surrounding the Arch&#x2019;s construction, and are therefore hard to use as evidence for new aesthetical concepts, as has frequently been propagated in the studies of the past three decades.</p>
<p>After a review on the <italic>status quaestionis</italic> in its broadest sense (&#x00A7; <sc>II</sc>), I will discuss several angles by which the Arch has been approached, mainly and foremost judged from the outward appearance, as a composite artwork constructed from several pictorial (and textual) elements and temporal layers. Departing from the established views, I will deconstruct the dominant interpretations by discussing several aspects that are often invoked as evidence: the supposition that the Arch is an object of propagandistic self-expression on the emperor&#x2019;s behalf, or the question of agency (&#x00A7; <sc>III</sc> and <sc>IV</sc>). Then, we will take into account the juridical context; as far as there is any evidence to underpin current views, it rather points towards a negative assessment of re-use of material in the early fourth century (&#x00A7; <sc>V</sc>). A new approach to the Arch will be proposed, combining the archaeological picture with textual evidence. It will turn out that the Arch mainly is a conventional monument in a traditional context, with some peculiarities that may count as innovations to the tradition (&#x00A7; <sc>VI</sc>). It will be shown how the Arch may be seen as the material counterpoint of spoken panegyric (&#x00A7; <sc>VII</sc>), which is an important element for a new approach to the arch as an architectural unity, combining art and text (Conclusion, &#x00A7; <sc>VIII</sc>).</p>

<label>2.2</label>
<title>State of the Discussion</title>
<p>Recent discussions concerning the Arch have focused particularly on approaches to art and materiality in Constantine&#x2019;s reign, starting from the observation that the Arch contains a mix of styles and temporal layers. In earlier decades the composite style of the Arch has been considered a sign of decay in artistic ability, especially because of the Constantinian sculpture on the lower parts of the Arch. In recent research the sculptural programme of the Arch, with its recycled material and eclectic combinations of works of art, is seen as a novel expression of Roman identity, prefiguring the veneration for ancient objects which was to become normal practice in the Middle Ages. Others have considered the re-use of material as driven by pragmatism, without however considering this detrimental to the overall artistic impact of the Arch.</p>
<p>The decorative elements from external provenance are normally designated as <italic>spolia</italic>, a notion originally referring to arms or equipment seized from an adversary&#x2019;s body.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110003"><sup>3</sup></xref> While originally these were showcased in, e.g., a temple of the god to which the victory was dedicated, later the <italic>spolia</italic> were represented in artistic expressions, as for example the <italic>spolia</italic> from the Punic wars exhibited on the Capitoline Hill.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110004"><sup>4</sup></xref> An elegy by the poet and general Gallus to Caesar Augustus concerns the showing of <italic>spolia</italic> on a temple.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110005"><sup>5</sup></xref> In archaeological discourse, a derivative meaning of <italic>spolia</italic> is the stripped and plundered goods from houses and temples. The reuse of materials has been re-evaluated in recent decades and developed into a field of research in its own right.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110006"><sup>6</sup></xref> The recent appreciation may be seen as a reaction to the formerly accepted judgement, in which the use of <italic>spolia</italic>, a feature of Constantinian art, was valued negatively.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110007"><sup>7</sup></xref></p>
<p>The High Renaissance artist Raphael, who also served as the pope&#x2019;s adviser on antiquities, observed a difference in artistic quality between the sculpture on the Arch from Antonine times and Constantine&#x2019;s era, a verdict followed by Gibbon.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110008"><sup>8</sup></xref> This negative assessment of the Arch&#x2019;s design still ruled in the earlier twentieth century.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110009"><sup>9</sup></xref> Elsner, at the end of the last century, challenged this disparaging evaluation and suggested that <italic>spolia</italic> may have been used as cultic objects. He did so by tracing the pious re-use of materials in churches from the Middle Ages back to Late Antiquity. While Elsner stated that &#x2018;Constantine&#x2019;s spin doctors were as masterly and creative as those of Augustus&#x2019;, Hansen was equally positive about the conscious recycling of material and the artistic value attached to it.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110010"><sup>10</sup></xref> The comparison however between Constantine&#x2019;s reign in the western half of the empire to Augustus&#x2019; centrally organised rule in Rome is highly problematic in itself, as is the comparison with medieval cult-relics.</p>
<p>Objections to Elsner&#x2019;s interpretation of <italic>spolia</italic> have been brought forward by those pleading for a more pragmatic interpretation of the re-use of material. There is little evidence to support the idea that the use of a <italic>spolium</italic> had memorial or monumental overtones. Coates-Stephens emphasises the lack of any contemporaneous texts which favour the interpretation, and draws a parallel with comparable monuments such as the Augustan <italic>Ara Pacis</italic>, in which no special appreciation of the use of older material can be perceived.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110011"><sup>11</sup></xref> From an archaeological point of view, Lancaster suggests a motive for re-use of older material in building constructions, arches in particular.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110012"><sup>12</sup></xref> For reasons of efficiency, earthenware was reused in arch constructions, such as the cupola in the empress Helena&#x2019;s grave near the Basilica of Santi Pietro and Marcellino at the Via Labicana, dated some ten years after the inauguration of Constantine&#x2019;s Arch. The amphorae used in this building originate from the <italic>mons testaceus</italic> (Monte Testaccio), a designated rubbish dump for used amphorae on the slopes of the Aventine near the Tiber. Lancaster explains the exploitation of this left-over material as &#x2018;evident need&#x2019; (in other words, scarcity), &#x2018;economic possibility&#x2019; (supply) and the resulting &#x2018;cultural acceptability&#x2019; &#x2013; which is the general acceptance of a practice of re-use of materials that had become standard in architecture.</p>

<title>Traditional Values</title>
<p>Scholars of Constantinian art who have employed methodologies from other disciplines contend that the medieval practice of piously recycling artefacts from the past can be traced to the time of Constantine. Connected to the ideological interpretation of <italic>spolia</italic>-use is the idea that Constantine is the last in a sequence of good emperors, and secondly, that the emperor himself had an active role in promoting his new reign in Rome.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110013"><sup>13</sup></xref> The sculpture on the upper parts of the Arch originate from the reigns of Trajan, Hadrian, and Antoninus, while the heads of emperors on certain reliefs were remodelled on the emperor Constantine&#x2019;s head, and eventually those of his father Constantius and co-emperor Licinius.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110014"><sup>14</sup></xref> According to the ideological interpretation, the recarving as well as the panels of Hadrian&#x2019;s hunting expeditions were supposed to show the imperial <italic>virtutes</italic> that were also present in the new emperor. This may be true, but only as a matter of <italic>aemulatio</italic>, without commemorating a specific emperor from the past. In Late Antiquity, Hadrian was far from considered a good emperor, and there is hardly any reason to suppose that the virtues of reigning emperors were presented as inherited from their predecessors, let alone the bad ones.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110015"><sup>15</sup></xref> The virtues were, with variations through the ages, idiosyncratic for emperorship as such, and applied to the reigning emperor as the one who embodied them better than all his predecessors, cumulatively or even exponentially.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110016"><sup>16</sup></xref> Apart from that, re-carving the heads were hardly perceived as an artistic virtue. Reuse of material may not have had any effect on the artistic value of the Arch, as it does not detract from the monumental impression and imperial grandeur still apparent.</p>
<p>The Arch, in other words, may not represent the emperor&#x2019;s propagandistic self-expression addressed to the newly conquered City, depicting the virtues with which he identified, adorned with an inscription of imperial self-promotion. The concept of a monument of propaganda is contradicted by the earlier existence of the Arch in a different guise and for different purposes. If built on Constantine&#x2019;s instruction, the Arch must have been constructed in a period of no more than two-and-a-half years, between Constantine&#x2019;s <italic>adventus</italic> at the end of October 312 and the anniversary of his ten-year reign in July 315 (his <italic>dies imperii</italic> was 25 July).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110017"><sup>17</sup></xref> It has been suggested that the Arch was in fact an altered version of the monument erected by Constantine&#x2019;s predecessor Maxentius, as happened in an act of appropriation with the basilica nova on the Forum Romanum and the emperor&#x2019;s grand portrait.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110018"><sup>18</sup></xref> Many of the Arch&#x2019;s ornaments might have had a different significance, possibly the choices of Constantine&#x2019;s defeated enemy who was his predecessor.</p>
<p>Our lack of evidence for a monument of propaganda is even more profound as there is no proof that the Arch was Constantine&#x2019;s initiative. The emperor&#x2019;s direct interference is often presupposed, while the inscription suggests a different interpretation; as a token of trust, constructed by the senate to woo a new emperor who had hardly shown interest in Rome.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110019"><sup>19</sup></xref> The Arch may be conceived as an expression of civic pride on the City&#x2019;s behalf, a challenge to the other imperial centres which were gaining importance throughout the empire while Rome, the capital of old, was looked upon in nostalgic sentiment. For these reasons, a centralised policy as supposed for Augustus, as a Roman-born emperor, cannot be attributed, without further explanation, to any emperor in Late Antiquity. It can, however, apply to the rival-emperor Maxentius, who held Augustus in high honour, and who &#x2013; more than any of his predecessors &#x2013; pursued a restoration policy in his style.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110020"><sup>20</sup></xref> Under Maxentius&#x2019; reign, the empire was to reach a new milestone, the next centenary to be celebrated in 315.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110021"><sup>21</sup></xref> The senate of Rome was struggling with an absent emperor after a period of classical Roman restoration policy. It seems more likely, therefore, that it was the senate which made Constantine the new focus of this specifically Roman celebration. The desire for the imperial <italic>praesentia</italic> is broadcast also in other media, particularly the panegyrical orations which invite the absent emperor to visit a city.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110022"><sup>22</sup></xref></p>

<title>Reputation</title>
<p>The question of recycling material elements, if approached only from an art-historical point of view, holds the risk that the results of one particular field of research are transferred to another without reserve. As for the art-historical approach, it can hardly be maintained that combining elements in art and architecture can be conceived as either a novelty or as an ideologically inspired message. From an historical viewpoint, taking into account the situation in which such an artwork took shape, many objections may be made to the proposed art-historical concept. It might be asked when and in what stage of the Arch&#x2019;s construction the reliefs were integrated in the Arch&#x2019;s design. Furthermore, can the cult of relics be attributed to Constantine&#x2019;s &#x2018;spin doctors&#x2019;? Maxentius, present in Rome and very well acquainted with its treasures from the past, was in a much better position to have had a hand in the overall design.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110023"><sup>23</sup></xref> If the design were of the Constantinian age, it would be questionable whether Constantine acted as the main agent in the construction.</p>
<p>Several studies are relevant to a discussion of the growing practice of recycling material in the fourth and fifth centuries. Their conclusions are generally cautious as regards the acceptability of reuse. Relevant legal and historical texts suggest that the practice of re-use hugely increased during this period, but there were also restrictions put on the excessive use of earlier materials; most of the laws are directed against stripping of buildings and places such as public monuments and graves.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110024"><sup>24</sup></xref> On the one hand, this shows that mobility of material and objects was indeed there, but on the other hand, the perceptions of this practice were not all equally positive. Narratives in historiography attest to people in public office critised for all too liberal behaviour in acquiring the recycled material needed for restoration, decoration and rebuilding.</p>
<p>While the written sources demonstrate that the artistic appreciation of recycling was limited, most, if not all relevant sources date from later periods, and apply to other parts of the empire than Rome. Ammianus (<italic>Res Gestae</italic> 27.3.7) is perhaps the most valuable source for reconstructing the legal situation in Rome at the end of Maximian&#x2019;s reign and the start of Constantine&#x2019;s. The passage discusses the performance of the city prefect Lampadius, who had been blamed for earlier misconduct, when praetor (c. 335&#x2013;340), for putting his own name on public buildings as a founder.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110025"><sup>25</sup></xref> This was perceived as a lack of respect, since earlier benefactors had financed the building and its restorations, a weakness in character from which the emperor Trajan was also said to suffer.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110026"><sup>26</sup></xref> Further in the narration, 27.3.9&#x2013;10, Lampadius fled to the Milvian Bridge, chased by a furious mob, who reproached the prefect for not ordering material (such as iron, lead, bronze) from the usual taxes when erecting new buildings or restoring old ones, a deed that apparently damaged his reputation.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110027"><sup>27</sup></xref></p>
<p>From the restrictions on stripping and plundering, and the caution in dedicating buildings in one&#x2019;s own name, it might tentatively be concluded that there was a certain consciousness of the integrity of buildings, and that moving and relocating objects was considered a dubious practice. Ammianus&#x2019; passage about the dedication of buildings to the original founder is immediately followed by a passage on <italic>spolia</italic> abuse. In Amm. Marc. 16.6.2, furthermore, a certain Dorus is mentioned whose task it was to watch over the antiquities, serving as a conservator whose function is otherwise unknown, but whose very presence may indicate a careful handling of antiquities.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110028"><sup>28</sup></xref> While the examples given may indicate a negative appreciation of re-contextualising building material, it must for present purposes be observed that any sign of artistic appreciation of the practice is lacking.</p>

<title>Legislation</title>
<p>An example of the legal domain from Constantinople may shed light on the situation in Rome; a law rendered in the <italic>Codex Theodosianus</italic> from the reign of Constantius <sc>II</sc>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110029"><sup>29</sup></xref> The law was declared valid back to the year 333, which is within the limits of the reign of Constantius&#x2019; father Constantine, and thus also includes Lampadius&#x2019; prefecture (see &#x00A7; <sc>IV</sc>). The law (<italic>Cod. Theod.</italic> 9.17.2) runs thus:<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110030"><sup>30</sup></xref> &#x2018;&#x2026; All who seized columns or marble from monuments or put down stones for the chalk-oven, must (&#x2026;) pay one pound of gold for every grave to the exchequer after investigation by the office of Your Providence. Also, those who destroyed or damaged the decoration should be held liable to that same penalty, as also the ones who sold monuments on their premises to merchants of chalk together with those who dared to buy these &#x2013; whatever is forbidden by divine prescript to be touched, cannot be purchased without pollution &#x2013; and in this manner, that a pound is claimed from each one. But if by official indication of the officials monuments are torn down, we demand, so that no penalty will be avoided under the pretext of public building [<italic>i.e</italic>.: the penalty for the illegal robbing of building material], that the same officials impose this fine, because they should have been paid for from taxes or other kinds of funding.&#x2019;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110031"><sup>31</sup></xref></p>
<p>At first sight, the legal text does not apply to the recycling of material in Constantine&#x2019;s Arch, as it must be dated twenty years later, and applies to the situation in Constantinople for the robbing and destruction of graves. It may, however, be applicable to construction policies in Constantinian Rome. The law was enforced during Constantine&#x2019;s reign, even if issued later, furthermore, the prohibition on trade of used material evokes a practice of stripping of monuments (in this case funerary monuments), and the resale of material (<italic>columnae, marmora</italic>) for other purposes, as well as the illegal practice of selling and buying material to the exchequer (<italic>fisci rationibus</italic>). Even if the material is used for public utility (<italic>sub specie publicae fabricationis</italic>), a fine has to be imposed, since public building has to be funded from other resources (<italic>ex vectigalibus vel aliis titulis</italic>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110032"><sup>32</sup></xref> Especially the latter addition applies to Lampadius&#x2019; misconduct, as he built and restored buildings <italic>non ex titulis solitis</italic>, but used public servants (<italic>apparitores</italic>) to buy material (<italic>plumbum, aes</italic> vel sim.), without paying for it (<italic>nulla pretia persolvendo</italic>). A large misuse of material and avoidance of official procedures, including sanctions on trespassing, are thus recorded in the sources.</p>
<p>From the two examples from the period 335&#x2013;340 &#x2013; the praetorship of Lampadius and the law against plunder &#x2013; we may conclude that severe measures were taken against stripping. The Arch erected in honour of Constantine will be no exception to the overall picture that material was re-used, but under strict rules and without any positive assessment, artistic or otherwise. Even if no objections are now known to the recycling of highly reputed artworks, this does not consequently mean that the practice was appreciated in its own terms.</p>

<title>Historical Context</title>
<p>By lack of contemporary historiographical sources, conclusions must be drawn from what the Arch itself reveals. In addition, the Arch&#x2019;s meaning and message may have changed through the years, from the earlier stages of its development in Maxentius&#x2019; times onwards. A reconsideration of the urban structure, the historical situation in which it was erected, and a comparison with other artistic expressions from the same period may contribute to a new interpretation of the Arch. First, urban context. The Arch was situated on the crossroads of four Augustan regions, from which the name <italic>capita bubula</italic> (&#x2018;at the oxen heads&#x2019;) is derived, which was also the birthplace of Augustus when born as Octavius.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110033"><sup>33</sup></xref> It was on the border of the Palatine pomerium, where the <italic>urbs quadrata</italic> had once been laid out by the City&#x2019;s founder Romulus with special ritual significance, most probably arousing the interest of the Arch&#x2019;s commissioner, Maxentius (as we have seen in &#x00A7; <sc>IV</sc> above). This classical-oriented emperor was planning to celebrate the centenary celebrations for the year 314, coinciding with the decennalia of his own reign. In 204, the emperor Septimius Severus had celebrated Rome&#x2019;s anniversary, at the occasion of which the Arch on the eastern slopes of the Capitol had been erected.</p>
<p>Together with the earlier nearby Arches, the new Arch, on the extension of the via triumphalis towards the via sacra, was to provide a new ritual pathway to the Capitol. The most restorative emperor in decades &#x2013; <italic>conservator urbis suae</italic> according to a much-discussed inscription &#x2013;, had given pride of place to Rome&#x2019;s and his own anniversary.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110034"><sup>34</sup></xref> His reign however, was overthrown by the victorious troops of his brother-in-law Constantine. Many monuments originally created to extoll the reign of an emperor of the <italic>ancien r&#x00E9;gime</italic>, such as the magnificent basilica on the Forum Romanum, and the colossal statue to furnish it, were now effaced (<italic>litura</italic>), re-elaborated and dedicated to the new emperor. Maxentius was branded a &#x2018;tyrant&#x2019;, a rebel, and his name erased from the historical records. A new inscription celebrated the victor (see below, note 47), in an attempt by the Roman senate to pledge loyalty to the new powers.</p>
<p>Second, a look at the Arch and its possible meaning. Approaching the Arch, a richly decorated but equally harmonious construction can be seen, containing sculpture from various periods, from Trajan&#x2019;s Dacian captives, to Hadrian&#x2019;s rondos, and imperial <italic>gesta</italic> and <italic>virtutes</italic> as shown by Marcus Aurelius (<italic>profectio, liberalitas, clementia, lustratio, adlocutio, ingressus</italic>, etc., see below). The archways are decorated with Trajanic reliefs inscribed <italic>liberatori urbis</italic> and <italic>fundatori quietis</italic>. The contemporary finishing touch (historically and artistically), is the frieze showing Constantine&#x2019;s expedition through Italy (the siege of Verona), the battle at the bridge, the entrance in Rome and the assembly on the Forum. On both the east and west flanks, a rising sun chariot and a descending variant can be seen, corresponding with a sacrifice to Apollo on one of the panels. The cosmic depictions not only showcase the East (the rising sun) and the West (the sun setting), but also represent the emperor&#x2019;s omnipresent power, by day and by night. Hovering over the top of the Arch, the colossal statue of the sun could be seen.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110035"><sup>35</sup></xref> Solar symbolism was part of the design, as was usual at least since Augustus, who was portrayed wearing a cuirass with eastern and western, solar and lunar symbols. These symbols, clearly to be seen by any passer-by, must have played a much larger role in visuality than re-use of material that can hardly be identified as such.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110036"><sup>36</sup></xref></p>
<p>Third, the series and sequence of triumphal arches. Constantine&#x2019;s Arch has often been compared to the older ones, such Septimius Severus&#x2019; Arch, or the Arco di Portogallo.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110037"><sup>37</sup></xref> Constantine&#x2019;s Arch is concluded to be mostly in line with established tradition.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110038"><sup>38</sup></xref> Yet other arches may reveal aspects of dedicating customs. The Augustan Arch of Dolabella on the Celian hill, integrated in the republican city wall <italic>porta Caelimontana</italic>, and fitting into the Augustan programme of restructuring the city and of division into regions, may serve as an example of transformation and renewed dedication.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110039"><sup>39</sup></xref> The building&#x2019;s inscription attests of official, formular language: &#x2018;The consuls Publius Cornelius Dolabella, Publius&#x2019; son, / [and] Gaius Iunius Silanus, Gaius Silanus&#x2019; son, priest of Mars, / have restored [this arch] following a senate&#x2019;s decree and approved of it.&#x2019;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110040"><sup>40</sup></xref> The Arch, in fact a recycled and dedicated city gate, has been restored after the senate&#x2019;s permission and dedicated in the two mentioned consuls&#x2019; names, as the official commissioners.</p>
<p>An arch on the Esquiline hill, also in use as a city gate (in the Servian wall) had been transformed into an arch in honor of Gallienus, who favored Christianity by granting Christians the right of property in <sc>AD</sc> 260.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110041"><sup>41</sup></xref> The inscription reads: &#x2018;To Gallienus the most indulgent emperor whose invincible virtue is only surpassed by his loyalty, and to Salonina the most revered empress, the foremost senator Aurelius Victor [dedicated this arch] to their divinity and majesty.&#x2019;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110042"><sup>42</sup></xref> The senator dedicated the arch to the absent emperor. Several elements of imperial nomenclature recur in the text: <italic>clementia, invicta virtus, pietas, numen</italic> and <italic>maiestas</italic>. The epigraphic customs were long-standing practice during Constantine&#x2019;s reign. Another inscription, <italic>CIL</italic> <sc>VI</sc> 40770a, may serve as an illustration of the standard communicative situation. The senator Q. Ceionius Caecina Verus dedicates the restoration of a bridge to the emperor Constantine and his Caesars Crispus and Constantine. The element of <italic>clementia</italic>, expanded with the epithet <italic>divina</italic>, is characteristic in addresses to the emperor, while also the sponsor senator Q. Ceionius Caecina is mentioned; he dedicates the restored bridge to the <italic>numen</italic> and <italic>maiestas</italic> of the imperial family, the father and his Caesar sons in case.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110043"><sup>43</sup></xref> Even so, in the case of Constantine&#x2019;s arch, the senate devotes the monument to the reigning emperor.</p>
<p>The Arch, just as other examples in the past, was re-dedicated and transformed into a triumphal monument beyond Augustan-Maxentian imagery, for an emperor who fostered his own cult of <italic>Deus Sol Invictus</italic>. The Arch was redestined for Constantine&#x2019;s <italic>decennalia</italic>. His triumphal entrance into the city of Rome, that may well have led along the passage from the <italic>via triumphalis</italic> to the <italic>via sacra</italic>, was a major theme in the celebration.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110044"><sup>44</sup></xref> The sculptural programme on the Arch has been decorated by reliefs of earlier emperors. The arch is styled <italic>arcum triumphis insignem</italic> in the inscription, most probably a reference to the triumph depicted on the frieze; the formula can again be interpreted at face value, as autoreferential.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110045"><sup>45</sup></xref></p>

<title>A Reading of the Arch</title>
<p>The comparative analysis between the message of the Arch and the panegyrics <sc>XII</sc>(9) and <sc>IV</sc>(10) may shed light on the interpretation as a whole, viewed in its historical context. The narrations in the orations <sc>XII</sc>(9) and <sc>IV</sc>(10) compare well, as sketched in the following graph:</p>

<graphic xlink:href="9789004446922_webready_content_m00011.jpg"/>
</fig>
<p>The monument, as well as the cited panegyrics, celebrates the emperor&#x2019;s deeds, on the occasion of his <italic>decennalia</italic> following the conquests of Italy, rather than the liberation of Rome. The message belongs to pagan culture, in a neoplatonic philosophical context.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110046"><sup>46</sup></xref> These issues will be dealt with in the following, regarding the Arch&#x2019;s sculptural program in comparison with the panegyrics.</p>
<p>The Senate and People of Rome (<italic>SPQR</italic>) dedicate the Arch to the emperor in a clearly pagan vein.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110047"><sup>47</sup></xref> Lenski 2008 shows the pagan connotation of <italic>instinctu divinitatis</italic>, evoking the ritual of <italic>evocatio</italic>, the invitation to a godhead to leave a besieged city in order to prevent <italic>sacrilegium</italic> and to move to a temple in the victorious city. Words such as <italic>divinitas</italic> and <italic>mens</italic>, &#x2018;divinity&#x2019; and &#x2018;spirit&#x2019;, reflect an abstract image of a god in Neoplatonic style.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110048"><sup>48</sup></xref> The Arch is not as much about the battle of the Milvian Bridge, as it is about the &#x2018;liberation of the City&#x2019; after a march through Italy.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110049"><sup>49</sup></xref> The orator of the year 313 praises the emperor for having restored the city of Rome as well as the entire empire: <italic>de recuperata Vrbe imperioque Romano</italic>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110050"><sup>50</sup></xref> In 2.4, he speaks of &#x2018;liberating the City&#x2019; (<italic>liberandae Vrbis tempus</italic>), and again in 3.3 (<italic>liberandae Vrbi</italic>). The inscriptions in the Arch&#x2019;s central passage hail the emperor as liberator of the city (<italic>liberatori Vrbis</italic>) and founder of peace <italic>(fundatori quietis)</italic>, as is also depicted on the frieze: a narration from the <italic>profectio</italic> to the battle in Verona up to the <italic>ingressus Vrbis</italic>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110051"><sup>51</sup></xref> The orator of 321, Nazarius, mentions the founding of peace <italic>Constituta enim et in perpetuum Roma fundata est</italic> &#x2026;, after the enemy has been destroyed.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110052"><sup>52</sup></xref> Equally, the Arch is only partly about the defeat of Maxentius; <italic>de tyranno cum omni factione suo</italic> evokes the entire march through Italy, that also contained the defeat of Maxentius&#x2019; general Pompeianus near Verona.</p>
<p>After the march through Italy, the liberation of the city and founding of peace form the central theme in both of the speeches,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110053"><sup>53</sup></xref> whose orators avoid using terminology of capture and defeat, as virtue prevails over the army&#x2019;s force and fortitude. In showing his virtue, the emperor operates as <italic>mens divina</italic>, mastering imperial virtues needed for organising human matters. The celestial theme that the Arch expresses by its architectural form, as well as the depiction of heavenly bodies, help to portray the emperor&#x2019;s position as intermediate between the heavenly and earthly realm, the <italic>divina mens</italic> that contemplates the cosmic <italic>Nous</italic> pervading the cosmos.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110054"><sup>54</sup></xref> The <italic>mens divina</italic>, mentioned in the Arch&#x2019;s inscription, pervades panegyric of this same period similarly, cf. <sc>XII</sc> (9) 26.1: <italic>sive tute quaedam vis mensque divina es</italic>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110055"><sup>55</sup></xref> The emperor is furthermore informed by heavenly advice, while his own judgment also bears a mark of the divine.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110056"><sup>56</sup></xref> The same holds for Nazarius&#x2019; speech, nine years later.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110057"><sup>57</sup></xref></p>
<p>The Arch itself on its lower tiers shows the earthly activities necessary for maintaining order on earth, the actions that rather show the emperor&#x2019;s <italic>virtus</italic> than his military bravery, as it is put in panegyrical speech. Panegyric &#x2013; <sc>XII</sc>(9) from <sc>AD</sc> 313 preceding the Arch, and <sc>IV</sc>(10) from 321 reacting to the very same motifs &#x2013; has all the elements that recur in the pictorial narrative on the frieze, showing that sculptural and literary motives are in agreement. A show of imperial virtue, further elaborated in the attic reliefs from the Antonine era, feature the motives of <italic>profectio, liberalitas, adlocutio</italic>, and <italic>adventus</italic> or <italic>ingressus</italic>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110058"><sup>58</sup></xref></p>
<p>Both the Arch and several of the Constantinian panegyrics celebrate an anniversary. Vows to the emperor, as seen on the Arch, on the occasion of his <italic>decennalia</italic> are also attested in <sc>IV</sc>(10), where Nazarius congratulates Constantine&#x2019;s sons for their five-year reign (<italic>quinquennalia</italic>), and looks forward to the next period of equal length, 2.3: &#x2018;The quinquennial celebrations of the most blessed Caesars keep us busy rejoicing, but already our hastening prayers &#x2026; have come to rest on the decennial celebrations which will come to pass.&#x2019;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110059"><sup>59</sup></xref> Equally, in <sc>AD</sc> 310 Constantine had been wished a thirty-year reign period, in <italic>Pan. Lat.</italic> <sc>VI</sc>(7) 21, where Victoria (also depicted above the opening of the central passage) offers the dedicatee three crowns symbolising three times ten years of reign. The rendering by crosses of this same period of reign, at both sides of the Arch by <italic>votis X</italic> and <italic>votis XX</italic>, draws upon this same theme of imperial celebration. Thirty years, of which ten had already passed, count as the maximum of conceivable reigning years.</p>
<p>Like the senate, who dedicates a monument in stone, the panegyrical orator dedicates a <italic>monumentum</italic>, which might as well denote an oratorical monument or even historiographical work (as a stone monument).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110060"><sup>60</sup></xref> No difference may be made between the senate&#x2019;s dedication of a monument in stone and the orator&#x2019;s address to the emperor in words. The main goal in both media is to extol the emperor, and the cause is that he conquered all his rivals and surpassed his predecessors, even if they are his ancestors. In Nazarius&#x2019; speech, the father Constantius admires his son for having become greater than he ever had been, and the father&#x2019;s fame put in the shadow by the victories of his son Constantine (14.6: <italic>pater, qui terrarum triumphis altiori tibi cesserat</italic>). This is a reversal (or rather a hyperbole) of the motive that the emperor tries to gain authority by an appeal to imperial ancestry, as Constantine had done by adopting Claudius Gothicus as his forefather.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN110061"><sup>61</sup></xref> Ancestors here serve as examples to surpass, rather than to follow. This panegyrical point of view calls into question the opinion that Constantine&#x2019;s Arch puts the honorand in a line of good emperors. Nazarius (<sc>IV</sc>[10] 1.1), after all, sings of &#x2018;the majestic praise of Constantine, who towers as far above the leaders of all ages as other leaders are distant from private men&#x2019;.</p>
<p>The Arch&#x2019;s original commissioner, ironically, is the one who returns under the label of &#x2018;tyrant&#x2019; in the inscription, on a monument restyled to the victor&#x2019;s honor. The procedure has textual counterparts. The <italic>HA</italic> lays claim to originality by devoting attention not only to the lives of the victorious emperors, but also to the defeated ones, such as Septimius Severus&#x2019; adversary Pescennius Niger. The anonymous author begins his description thus, <italic>vita Pescennii Nigri</italic> 1.1: &#x2018;It is an unusual task and a difficult one to set down fairly in writing the lives of men, who, through other men&#x2019;s victories, remained mere pretenders, and for this reason not all the facts concerning such men are preserved in our records and histories in full.&#x2019; The quote shows the principles of erasing the memory of the defeated from the historical record. It also employs the notion of &#x2018;tyrant&#x2019;, most probably taken from Constantian context, maybe even taken directly from the inscription under discussion.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Ever since the increase of scholarly interest in the concept of recycling, the <italic>communis opinio</italic> has taken root that the Arch of Constantine is a beginning of a novel concept of art, prefiguring the later cult of relics as seen in the Medieval period. Combined with the view that the Arch is a monument of propagandistic character, designed by the &#x2018;spin-doctors&#x2019; of a new ruler in Rome, interpretations of the Arch and its message have become current that no longer agrees with a coherent view on the proper character of the Arch. Circumstantial evidence as appears from the urban context, and textual parallels from comparable messages result in a different concept. As to the urban context, it was Constantine&#x2019;s predecessor Maxentius who was responsible for the choice of the highly symbolic place near Augustus&#x2019; birthplace. Regarding textual evidence, passages from legal (<italic>Codex Theodosianus</italic>) and historiographical (Ammianus Marcellinus) texts make clear that the appreciation for re-use of objects cannot be proven without speculation and backward chaining.</p>
<p>The imperial virtues as displayed in the Arch&#x2019;s <italic>spolia</italic> did not serve to commemorate predecessors, or create a succession of good emperors, but as an incentive to the new ruler to surpass them (as we have seen in &#x00A7; <sc>III</sc> and <sc>IV</sc>). Use of <italic>spolia</italic> was restricted by law, and excessive use of it was considered morally blameworthy, in the eyes of the elite as well as the people (&#x00A7; <sc>V</sc>). The practice of <italic>spolia</italic> use (as well as the discussion about it) was indeed present to a certain extent, which may hardly surprise in an empire with a capital that was quite literally built from <italic>spolia</italic>, Constantinople (see note 29). The evidence from the two examples of legislature against spoliation (from the period 335&#x2013;340) may be strenghtened with the arguments ensuing from the recycling of two city gates, and the dedication of a bridge to Constantine (&#x00A7; 6): the comparisons lead to the conclusion that the outward appearance and textual support on the monuments themselves must be taken at face value. The texts, in connection with the object, appear to be quite precise about the commissioner, the honorand and the status of the monument. The senate must have funded the Arch <italic>ex solitis titulis</italic>, that is, on their own expenses.</p>
<p>Epigraphical evidence (from arches and bridges in comparable communicative situations, &#x00A7; <sc>VI</sc> above) and iconographic analysis suggest that the Arch, originally commissioned by Maxentius for the celebration of Rome&#x2019;s centenary, is rooted in classical tradition, which did not change after his successor had captured the City. The eclecticism as seen on the Arch can be explained by its restructuring from a monument of <italic>Romanitas</italic> to a triumphal monument dedicated by the Roman senate to a new and mostly absent ruler. The Arch, moreover, bears a particularly pagan message, dedicated by the senate to the emperor. The imagery evokes an equally august (and Augustan) as celestial atmosphere that fits the solar imagery that defines the context of the Arch, also depicted on the eastern and western flanks. The solar imagery recurs on its sides, and has a counterpart in the solar imagery in panegyrical speech: the emperor and his <italic>divina mens</italic> as intermediate between the heavenly and earthly realm.</p>
<p>The narrative on the Arch as expressed in the panels showing Constantine&#x2019;s march through Italy may also be seen in the light of rhetorical <italic>narratio</italic>, as was shown in the speeches <sc>XII</sc>(9) and <sc>IV</sc>(10) from 313 and 321 respectively (&#x00A7; <sc>VII</sc> above). Just as in these speeches, the Arch addresses the march as much as it regards the entrance into the City, the liberation of Rome and the founding of peace. Other literary motives, such as the suppression of foreign people, both figure in the architecture of the monument as in the text of the speeches. Even so, the Arch is only partly about the defeat of Maxentius at the Milvian Bridge; <italic>de tyranno cum omni factione suo</italic> also includes the battle against Pompeianus. Thus, the Arch as a monument dedicated by the entirely pagan senate, calls attention to a victorious emperor who is mostly absent. The senate honours the new emperor by re-dedicating a predecessor&#x2019;s monument, and is constantly wishing and waiting for his return.</p>

<p>Noteworthy is Barcel&#x00F3;&#x2019;s 1990 article providing an interpretation of the Arch as a whole.

<p>The view is a reaction to the negative approach, as voiced among others by L&#x2019;Orange and Von Gerkan 1939, 4&#x2013;33, who consider the development of art in Constantine&#x2019;s times as a loss of technical ability and a sign of artistic decay; also Berenson 1954.</p>

<p>Hansen 2015, 13&#x2013;14 articulates the current view, not only by tracing back later practice to earlier situations, but also indicating the art of Constantine&#x2019;s times as a new starting point, with an active role of the emperor in the process. Carlson 2010, treating the Arch in relation with panegyrical speeches, adheres to the majority view. Brenk 1987, 105 has styled the Arch &#x2018;a prominent monument of imperial propaganda by definition&#x2019;. Marlowe 2010, 206 takes the opposite stance and criticises this &#x2018;blatantly teleological view&#x2019;. Koortbojian 2020, 125 however observes that &#x2018;the view that this was a senatorial monument has become, by and large, <italic>communis opinio</italic>&#x2019; (see also n.125 with bibliography), a view he challenges in return.</p>

<p>The <italic>introitus</italic> as depicted on the Arch was not a triumph in the traditional, and juridical, sense, but had the appearence of a military procession, the emperor bearing his military garment and without triumphal chariot, and no senators accompanying the entrance, see Koortbojian 2020, 146 and <italic>passim</italic>.</p>

<p>The formula <italic>arcum triumphis insignem</italic> reminds somewhat of the famous Vergilian epithet for Aeneas, founder of the Roman <italic>gens</italic>: <italic>insignem pietate virum</italic> (&#x2018;a man outstanding in piety&#x2019;, <italic>A</italic> <sc>I</sc>.10). The autoreferential interpretation is object of discussion, see Liverani 2014, 11&#x2013;12, who categorises the communicative situation semiotically as &#x2018;Tipo A1 &#x2013; enunciatore ed enunciatorio esterni impersonali&#x2019; &#x2013; he does not see any relation between the verbal expression and the visual art &#x2013; in other words, there is no deictic aspect in <italic>arcum insignem</italic>. On the other hand, the inscriptions in the Archway, mentioned above, do direct the spectators&#x2019; interpretation of the reliefs. See Koortbojian 2020, 134&#x2013;41, who emphasises a lack of evidence for an actual triumph, the occasion for the arch&#x2019;s dedication being the <italic>decennalia</italic> of the emperor&#x2019;s reign.</p>

<p>As argued in Burgersdijk 2020 for the panegyrical orations of Tetrarchic and Constantinian times. Neoplatonic overtones of the Arch&#x2019;s inscription were detected by Lenski 2008, who identified the term <italic>instinctu divinitatis</italic> convincingly as a traditional pagan formula. This use corresponds with the use of divine terminology in the panegyrics.</p>

<p>Purple, a dye obtained with great effort from sea snails,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN120000"><sup>*</sup></xref> was a very expensive substance, and its use therefore became a symbol of royal dignity in Antiquity, probably even as far back as the Bronze Age.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN120001"><sup>1</sup></xref> In Greek classical literature, such dignity was evoked allusively by the purple carpet on which the king of Argos treads when he comes into his palace in Aeschylus&#x2019; <italic>Agamemnon</italic> (vv. 910&#x2013;965). In the Roman Empire, purple was a distinctive symbol of imperial dignity, long before and after Constantine (272&#x2013;337), on whom this article focuses. It analyses the role played by purple in relation to the depiction of Constantine in Eusebius&#x2019; <italic>Life of Constantine</italic>, an extensive and atypical panegyric in four books completed after the death of the emperor in 337.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN120002"><sup>2</sup></xref> In order to outline the Roman background of this symbol of imperial power and discuss the question within a broad literary context, the Eusebian text will be read in relation to other encomiastic works that also speak about Constantine and purple. As they date to an earlier time, two <italic>Pan. Lat</italic>. <sc>VI</sc>(7) and <sc>XII</sc>(9), are examined first. Both were addressed to the son of Constantius Chlorus and delivered before the <italic>Life of Constantine</italic> was composed, in 310 and 313 respectively, by anonymous pagan orators.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN120003"><sup>3</sup></xref></p>
<p>In the first discourse, the Latin panegyrist narrates how Constantine assumed the imperial purple in Eboracum (York) in 306 as a sign of his being the successor of the dead emperor, his father Constantius Chlorus. His soldiers are said to have bestowed on Constantine the imperial symbol despite his grief after the death of Constantius. By accepting the garment, Constantine recognised and proclaimed that he was the new Augustus: &#x2018;straightaway the soldiers threw the purple over you despite your tears, taking more account of the public advantage than your feelings, for it was not right to mourn any longer a ruler who had been consecrated as a god&#x2019; (<italic>Pan. Lat.</italic> <sc>VI</sc>[7] 8.3).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN120004"><sup>4</sup></xref> It should not be forgotten that this measure went against the inheritance system of the Tetrarchy, and that Constantine&#x2019;s election was therefore not immediately accepted by his father&#x2019;s colleagues.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN120005"><sup>5</sup></xref></p>
<p>Purple appears again in this Panegyric (<sc>VI</sc>[7]), likewise as a symbol of the imperial condition, but now in a new context and in relation to its irregular use. According to the anonymous pro-Constantinean panegyrist, it would have been an abuse if the old tetrarch Maximianus (<italic>ca</italic>. 250&#x2013;310) had usurped the imperial dignity and the purple as he intended: &#x2018;suddenly to take up a position within the walls, clad in purple, and usurp imperial power, twice laid down, for the third time&#x2019; (<italic>Pan. Lat.</italic> <sc>VI</sc>[7] 16.1).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN120006"><sup>6</sup></xref></p>
<p>The improper use of purple is actually the point shared by the two references to this material symbol which appear in the twelfth Panegyric, and in both cases the usurper is Maxentius (<italic>ca.</italic> 278&#x2013;312), the son of Maximianus, about whom neither Christian nor pagan sources speak in positive terms.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN120007"><sup>7</sup></xref> In the first passage (<italic>Pan. Lat.</italic> <sc>XII</sc>[9] 3.4), Maximianus attempts to tear the purple from the shoulders of his own son, whom he considers an &#x2018;abomination&#x2019;: &#x2018;finally, he who was believed to be his father, after attempting to tear the purple from his shoulders, perceived that his own destiny had passed over to that abomination.&#x2019;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN120008"><sup>8</sup></xref> Maxentius is later referred to (<italic>Pan. Lat.</italic> <sc>XII</sc>[9] 16.3) as the &#x2018;little slave who dressed himself in purple for so many years.&#x2019;</p>
<p>No other mention is made of imperial dress in the five <italic>Panegyrici Latini</italic> addressed to Constantine.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN120009"><sup>9</sup></xref> Therefore, there is scant reference to purple as a symbol of imperial dignity. It could be that the unknown composers of these panegyrics had separately thought that magnificent symbols like purple must be employed sparingly, if their impressive function is to be preserved. Anyway, and more importantly, these limited references to purple seem to establish an important fact; only Constantine wears purple in a legitimate way and on the proper occasions, without any kind of eccentricity or impropriety as in the case of usurpers such as Maximian and Maxentius. Moreover, and as will be seen later in the case of the <italic>Life of Constantine</italic>, the emperor&#x2019;s use of purple avoids the kind of <italic>hybris</italic> committed by the abovementioned Agamemnon. As a king, Agamemnon may have had the right to wear purple when he returned home, but it was an abuse, and therefore <italic>hybris</italic>, to tread on a material reserved for the gods, as he himself acknowledges in his tragedy (vv. 946&#x2013;949).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN120010"><sup>10</sup></xref></p>
<p>In order to establish a broader understanding of imperial purple in the fourth century <sc>AD</sc>, it is also advisable to consider the evidence of two other <italic>Latin Panegyrics</italic> that are not directly related to Constantine. These are <italic>Pan. Lat.</italic> <sc>III</sc>(11), an encomium addressed to Julian by Mamertinus (362), and <italic>Pan. Lat.</italic> <sc>II</sc>(12), written by Pacatus and dedicated to Theodosius in 389. While the first text contains three mentions of purple, the second includes seven, which clearly contradicts the situation in the previously discussed speeches.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN120011"><sup>11</sup></xref></p>
<p>Like <italic>Pan. Lat.</italic> <sc>VI</sc>(7) and <sc>XII</sc>(9), both panegyrics refer to people who wear the imperial attribute improperly in different circumstances. This is the case in <sc>III</sc>(11) 30.3, which speaks about the &#x2018;haughtiness&#x2019; of previous emperors dressed in purple (<italic>fastidia purpuratorum</italic>), who granted their friends great honours to avoid their being despised. Since Mamertinus indicates that this happened &#x2018;a little before&#x2019; (<italic>paulo antea</italic>), the allusion must refer to Constantius <sc>II</sc>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN120012"><sup>12</sup></xref> <italic>Pan. Lat.</italic> <sc>II</sc>(12) repeatedly attacks Magnus Maximus, the usurper who fought against Theodosius and is called a &#x2018;purple-clad butcher&#x2019; (<italic>carnifici purpurato</italic>: <sc>II</sc>[12] 24.1).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN120013"><sup>13</sup></xref> Pacatus refers later (<sc>II</sc>[12] 26.1) to the enormous greed of this usurper, who is also labelled <italic>purpuratus</italic>. In <sc>II</sc>(12).45.1, Maximus is even framed as a warning to any future pretenders who would wear the purple without deserving this honour: &#x2018;if anyone at any time dreams of draping his shoulders with royal purple may he encounter the depiction of Maximus being stripped.&#x2019;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN120014"><sup>14</sup></xref></p>
<p>On the other hand, and in a positive way, <italic>Pan. Lat.</italic> <sc>III</sc>(11) 23.4 states that Julian dignified philosophy; having been a dishonored matter in the past, thereafter it sat &#x2018;covered by purple&#x2019; on the imperial throne, as if Julian were the personification of this discipline.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN120015"><sup>15</sup></xref> <italic>Pan. Lat.</italic> <sc>II</sc>(12) 16.2 says something almost identical in relation to Theodosius and Friendship: &#x2018;Friendship (&#x2026;) you not only summoned to the palace, but clothed in purple, wreathed in gold and installed on the throne.&#x2019;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN120016"><sup>16</sup></xref> It is also interesting that <italic>Pan. Lat.</italic> <sc>III</sc>(11) 5.4 mentions purple when it speaks about the possibility of removing the &#x2018;blush of sacred modesty&#x2019; (<italic>purpuram sancti ruboris</italic>) from the virtue of Temperance, figured in the person of Julian, thus alluding indirectly perhaps to Julian&#x2019;s blush.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN120017"><sup>17</sup></xref></p>
<p>Two other works relating directly to Constantine may be regarded as part of the literary context of Eusebius&#x2019;s <italic>Vita Constantini</italic>. The first is another panegyric, <italic>In Praise of Constantine</italic>, composed by the bishop of Caesarea himself, and pronounced in 336 during the celebration of the thirtieth anniversary of the reign of Constantine.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN120018"><sup>18</sup></xref> The second text is the <italic>Oration to the Assembly of the Saints</italic>, addressed by Constantine to an assembly of bishops, supposedly written by him in Latin and, according to Eusebius, later translated into Greek (<italic>Life of Constantine</italic> 4.32). It was delivered on an uncertain date between 312/313 and 325, and it is not clear if Eusebius or other clerics (Lactantius) played a role in its composition.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN120019"><sup>19</sup></xref> Purple is mentioned in both works and plays a role congruent with its public use and Roman tradition as attested by the <italic>Panegyrici Latini</italic>.</p>
<p>The first reference to purple in the speech <italic>In Praise of Constantine</italic> (5.4) is very explicit in relation to the meaning of the imperial vestment and to the fact that only Constantine can wear the <italic>halourgis</italic>, the name Eusebius gives to the purple robe in this passage and in his panegyrics in general:<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN120020"><sup>20</sup></xref> &#x2018;Declaring the august title of supreme authority by the splendor of his vesture, he alone worthily wears that imperial purple which so well becomes him.&#x2019;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN120021"><sup>21</sup></xref> A similar case is to be seen in a second passage from this speech (5.6). On this occasion the purple is accompanied by another distinctive imperial attribute, the diadem:<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN120022"><sup>22</sup></xref> &#x2018;He [Constantine] smiles at his vesture, embroidered with gold and flowers, and at the imperial purple and diadem itself, when he sees the multitude gaze in wonder, like children at a bugbear, on the splendid spectacle.&#x2019; Moral considerations are added just after the cited text, and then Eusebius speaks about another &#x2018;garment&#x2019; (<italic>periblema</italic>) that coats the emperor&#x2019;s soul; knowledge of &#x2018;the Divine.&#x2019; This metaphorical vestment is also &#x2018;temperance, justice, piety, and all other virtues&#x2019; (&#x03C3;&#x03C9;&#x03C6;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x03CD;&#x03BD;&#x1FC3; &#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x1F76; &#x03B4;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x1F7B;&#x03BD;&#x1FC3; &#x03B5;&#x1F50;&#x03C3;&#x03B5;&#x03B2;&#x03B5;&#x1F77;&#x1FB3; &#x03C4;&#x03B5; &#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x1F76; &#x03C4;&#x03B1;&#x1FD6;&#x03C2; &#x03BB;&#x03BF;&#x03B9;&#x03C0;&#x03B1;&#x1FD6;&#x03C2; &#x1F00;&#x03C1;&#x03B5;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;&#x1FD6;&#x03C2;), which is said to fit the emperor especially well, as it is &#x2018;a vesture such as truly becomes a sovereign.&#x2019;</p>
<p>Such ethical commentaries are coherent with the kind of eulogies employed in secular encomiastic literature, and specifically in the <italic>basilikos logos</italic>, in which the four cardinal virtues (&#x1F00;&#x03BD;&#x03B4;&#x03C1;&#x03B5;&#x03AF;&#x03B1;, &#x03B4;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x1F7B;&#x03BD;&#x03B7;, &#x03C3;&#x03C9;&#x03C6;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x03CD;&#x03BD;&#x03B7;, &#x03C6;&#x03C1;&#x03CC;&#x03BD;&#x03B7;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03C2;) should be taken into account, as Menander Rhetor&#x2019;s theoretical exposition (373) avers.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN120023"><sup>23</sup></xref> In relation to this, it is relevant that Constantine&#x2019;s appearance attests to his moral condition when he enters the palace of his dead father according to the sixth <italic>Pan.

The repeated reference to a general virtue like <italic>dikaiosyne</italic> / <italic>iustitia</italic>, recommended by the rhetorical treatises about the <italic>basilikos logos</italic> as noted above, is, of course, insufficient as evidence to conclude that the two discourses are intertextually related.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN120025"><sup>25</sup></xref> The significant point here is that the passage from <italic>In Praise of Constantine</italic> (5.6), like the one cited above (5.4), speaks about the emperor and his purple in terms which would have probably fit within any pagan panegyric, even though mention of purple was not an eulogical usual element in a <italic>basilikos logos</italic>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN120026"><sup>26</sup></xref></p>

<p>All rose at a signal, which announced the Emperor&#x2019;s entrance; and he finally walked along between them, like some heavenly angel of God, his bright mantle shedding lustre like beams of light, shining with the fiery radiance of a purple robe, and decorated with the dazzling brilliance of gold and precious stones.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This passage makes intentional use of <italic>enargeia</italic> and focuses on the physical appearance of the emperor as various textual markers show.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN120036"><sup>36</sup></xref> As in the case of <italic>In Praise of Constantine</italic> (5.6), it is followed (in 3.10.4) by comments on the emperor&#x2019;s internal disposition. Thus a coherent image of Constantine is presented, both external and internal, whose general tone is advanced by the initial encomiastic comparison: &#x2018;like some heavenly angel of God.&#x2019; According to Eusebius, the almighty Augustus appears before the clergy as a heavenly angel of God whose most distinctive visible features are light and brightness because of the combined effect of gold and precious stones which adorn his garments. As part of this brightness he is also described as wearing a purple robe (<italic>halourgis</italic>), which makes him shine because it blazes, in the text&#x2019;s hyperbole, with a fiery radiance.</p>
<p>The comparison of a man with an angel of God was problematic, because it could be regarded as an exaggeration and the first step towards <italic>hybris. Hybris</italic> may in fact be suggested by a reference to purple, as the example of Agamemnon in his tragedy cited above shows.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN120037"><sup>37</sup></xref> But the Aeschylean Agamemnon is a very different figure from the Eusebian hero. Eusebius is careful to show that Constantine, this &#x2018;angel of God&#x2019;, is not guilty of <italic>hybris</italic>. As alluded to above, he does so through textual comments on Constantine&#x2019;s external appearance which reflect his internal excellence: the emperor is humble because his eyes are cast down, his face blushes (cf. n. 25), his gait is decorous, and the rest of his appearance evinces, according to Eusebius, his moral disposition.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN120038"><sup>38</sup></xref></p>
<p>In the first passage from the <italic>Life of Constantine</italic> (1.22.1) purple, or purple garments, signified imperial dignity and the status of emperor in accordance with Roman tradition. Eusebius now goes a step further, as purple is dyed with new and supernatural shades in this second text. As he opens the Council of Nicaea, Constantine is not only the emperor of Rome. Although not yet baptised, he had become a kind of <italic>episcopus maximus</italic> among Christian bishops.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN120039"><sup>39</sup></xref> Significantly, he wears shining purple when he assumes this role. It should be recalled that not only was purple significant in social and political contexts in Antiquity, it also played an important role in ancient religions such as Judaism.</p>
<p>This is well attested to in the Old Testament, in the book of Exodus, which prescribes that the tent of the Tabernacle (cf. Exod. [<sc>LXX</sc>] 26.1, 31, 36) and other religious objects be made of purple, at least partially (cf. Exod. [<sc>LXX</sc>] 27.16; 36.9, 10, 12, 15, 31, 36; 37.3, 5, 16; 39.12). More importantly, purple was also a significant element of the vestments which the High Priest should wear, as Exodus states in relation to his garments in general, and the priestly clothing known as ephod, the pectoral, and the mantle of the ephod, in particular (cf. Exod. [<sc>LXX</sc>] 28.5, 8, 15, 33).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN120040"><sup>40</sup></xref> If Eusebius&#x2019; text is read against the background of what Exodus prescribes in relation to purple, Constantine&#x2019;s procession among the assembled bishops wearing his purple robe may be interpreted as meaning that the son of Constantius Chlorus no longer walks among them solely as the emperor of Rome. It has often been noted that Eusebius converted the figure of Moses into a recurrent point of comparison for the Augustus in his <italic>Vita Constantini</italic>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN120041"><sup>41</sup></xref> Likewise in relation to Exodus, in which Moses appears, it may be added that Eusebius presents Constantine in this significant passage of his eulogy as a kind of High Priest, as if Constantine&#x2019;s imperial purple were embedded in the ritual purple which characterises the High Priest in the second book of the Old Testament.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN120042"><sup>42</sup></xref></p>
<p>The references to the purple in the first and third books of the <italic>Life of Constantine</italic> must also be read in relation to what is said about this material in the fourth book. Purple appears once again there, and it does so in a very different context and with a very different role.

<p>Constantine was initiated by rebirth in the mysteries of Christ, and exulted in the Spirit on being vouchsafed the divine seal, and was renewed and filled with divine light (&#x2026;), awestruck at the manifestation of the divinely inspired power. When the due ceremonies were complete, he put on bright imperial clothes which shone like light, and rested on a pure white couch, being unwilling to touch a purple robe again.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In this text, &#x2018;when the due ceremonies were complete&#x2019; refers to the rite of baptism which Constantine received only when he felt the proximity of impending death, inaugurating in this way an approach that became common among Christian emperors in the fourth century until Theodosius the Great.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN120044"><sup>44</sup></xref> Light, brightness, luminosity, clearness, are concepts which also recur in this passage, as they did at the inauguration of the Council in Nicaea. Now Constantine is said to have been filled with a light which is divine, and this will be repeated by the emperor himself when Eusebius cites his own words in the next chapter.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN120045"><sup>45</sup></xref> The divine power which astonishes Constantine is said to be visible, and Eusebius expresses this idea using a significant adjective, in this instance nominalised, <italic>to enarges</italic>, &#x2018;the visible&#x2019;, related to <italic>enargeia</italic>, &#x2018;clearness, distinctness, vividness&#x2019;, a central concept in the presentation of the imperial image in the <italic>Life of Constantine</italic> as already argued in relation to 3.10.3&#x2013;4.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN120046"><sup>46</sup></xref> As noted above also, the emperor is later dressed in new clothes, characterised by their brightness: they are said first to be &#x2018;bright&#x2019; and then, redundantly, to shine &#x2018;like light.&#x2019; These imperial garments are not explicitly said to be white, as was usual from Antiquity in the case of the newly baptised (cf. Cyr.H. <italic>Myst.</italic> 4.8). But whiteness may be suggested by &#x2018;bright&#x2019;, <italic>lampros</italic>, which can have the same meaning as <italic>candidus</italic> in Latin, &#x2018;shining white&#x2019;, as when Polybius (10.5.1) translates the Roman expression <italic>toga candida</italic> as <italic>lampra esthes</italic>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN120047"><sup>47</sup></xref> The fundamental point to be underlined is that the emperor no longer wants to wear the purple cloth, nor even to touch it (<italic>VC</italic> 4.66.1). This procedure repeats and transcends the ritual unclothing of the catechumens who remove their old garments before receiving baptism. In the case of the Roman emperor, the casting off of the metaphorical brightness of purple which played a central role in 3.10.4 has as its counterpart the reception of the true light, the &#x2018;divine light&#x2019; which Constantine receives on the occasion of his baptism, as related by Eusebius in the fourth book.</p>
<p>In exploring a previous text (<italic>VC</italic> 3.10.3&#x2013;4), the testimony of the Old Testament was drawn into discussion to suggest that the scene depicting the entrance of Constantine into the Council of Nicaea may be better understood when it is read in the light of the Exodus passages which prescribe how the vestments worn by the High Priest should be prepared when he fulfils his ritual duties. In the case of the later text addressed here, purple acquires new, negative connotations. These are not to be found in the Old Testament but are typical of the New, whose evidence should be considered at this point.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN120048"><sup>48</sup></xref> In this part of the Bible, as in the passage from the fourth book of the <italic>Life of Constantine</italic> analysed above, purple becomes a symbol of vanity, deception, and even evil. Fourth-century Christian writers also spoke of the purple in a negative sense, like their pagan contemporaries (cf. n. 37); this is especially evident in many texts by such prominent authors of this age as the three Cappadocian Fathers.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN120049"><sup>49</sup></xref></p>
<p>There are a number of references to purple (always <italic>porphyra</italic>)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN120050"><sup>50</sup></xref> in the New Testament, and at least one of them is purely factual.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN120051"><sup>51</sup></xref> In other instances, purple is mentioned in the New Testament in negative terms. Purple means, for example, a form of wealth that is insensitive to the needs of poor Lazarus, according to the parable in the Gospel of Luke (16.19). Purple also appears as a characteristic of evil in the Apocalypse, as part of the ornaments which embellish the woman who is the Great Prostitute and, at the same time, Babylon (17.4&#x2013;5), the damned city whose destiny is decried by the sellers from whom she used to buy purple and other luxurious goods (18.11&#x2013;12, 16).</p>
<p>The main scene in which purple plays a role in the New Testament is the Passion of Jesus, as narrated by Matthew, Mark and John. The situation is different in the case of Luke because, according to his gospel (23.11), it was Herod who put a cloak on Jesus, and it was a white cloak, before sending him back to Pilate; this text (cf. <italic>Eu.Luc.</italic> 23.1&#x2013;25) does not mention the Roman soldiers putting their hands on the captive before the crucifixion. Matthew, Mark and John refer to the garrison mocking Jesus by assigning him royal attributes that are in no way appropriate in the case of a prisoner who is soon to be executed or somebody who is soon to die, as Constantine was at this moment in his <italic>Life</italic>. The aforementioned attributes are a false sceptre (only in Matthew 27.29: &#x2018;they &#x2026; placed a reed in his right hand&#x2019;),<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN120052"><sup>52</sup></xref> a crown of thorns (in the three evangelists), and a vestment which is &#x2018;purple&#x2019; in Mark (15.17) or a &#x2018;purple cloak&#x2019; in John (19.2).</p>
<p>Obviously it is unthinkable that the soldiers of the garrison would have had purple garments at their disposal, or moreover that they would have used them to dress a bloodied Jesus who had been already scourged (cf. <italic>Eu.Matt.</italic> 27.26; <italic>Eu.Marc.</italic> 15.15; <italic>Eu.Io.</italic> 19.1). In fact, Matthew (27.28) says that the soldiers changed his vestments for a scarlet cloak, probably a military one: &#x2018;And they stripped him and put a scarlet cloak round him.&#x2019; That may have been enough for the farce which the soldiers were presenting. They saluted Jesus as the King of the Jews (&#x2018;Hail, king of the Jews!&#x2019;),<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN120053"><sup>53</sup></xref> and even prostrated before him as before an emperor according to Matthew 27.29 (&#x2018;To make fun of him they knelt to him&#x2019;) and Mark 15.19 (&#x2018;They went down on their knees to do him homage&#x2019;). As everything was a farce, they did not refrain from spitting and hitting this supposed sovereign on the head.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN120054"><sup>54</sup></xref> Once the mockery was finished, Jesus was once more made a simple prisoner condemned to death and therefore the soldiers took away the spurious royal purple robe.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN120055"><sup>55</sup></xref></p>
<p>Purple is mentioned for the last time in the fourth book of the <italic>Life of Constantine</italic>, in 4.66, and then with significant variations in comparison with its appearance in the scene of Constantine&#x2019;s baptism (4.62.4). After the baptism had taken place and the emperor had died, the bishop of Caesarea tells that the soldiers lifted the body of the Augustus, brought it to Constantinople, and displayed it on an elevated place in the imperial palace.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN120056"><sup>56</sup></xref> It is said that the coffin in which the corpse was laid had been wrapped in purple, which is now for the first time in the <italic>Vita Constantini</italic> &#x2018;imperial purple&#x2019;, <italic>halourgidi basilike</italic> (4.66.1). Moreover, a new reference to purple, now <italic>porphyra</italic> for the first time, comes next, when it is said that the emperor was &#x2018;arrayed in the symbols of sovereignty, the purple and the diadem&#x2019; (4.66.2). The poignant institutional occasion of the <italic>funus imperatorum</italic><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN120057"><sup>57</sup></xref> explains why the purple is now &#x2018;imperial&#x2019;, why it is mentioned together with the diadem, and why Constantine is again vested with purple, the symbol he had rejected shortly before.</p>
<p>At the end of this analysis it may be said that purple is actually a recurring visual element which contributes to defining the image of the emperor in the Eusebian <italic>Life of Constantine</italic>; it is one of those important iconological elements of the <italic>Life</italic> for which, as noted by Van Nuffelen in 2013, a comprehensive study is not yet available.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN120058"><sup>58</sup></xref> And, as previously argued, purple appears repeatedly in this work as a kind of milestone. It may be added that this hallmark has a kaleidoscopic character. In an official, secular sense, purple means Roman imperial power in the work of Eusebius, as seen in the first and last references in the <italic>Life</italic>, in the eulogy <italic>In Praise of Constantine</italic>, and in the contemporaneous <italic>Panegyrici Latini</italic>. Purple also means imperial dignity in the account of the Council of Nicaea. However, in this climactic moment of the <italic>Life of Constantine</italic>, it expresses new, religious and ritual notions, as best appreciated if the passage is read in light of the Old Testament and in comparison with other patristic texts. The rejection of purple may express Constantine&#x2019;s most deeply held convictions and it does so paradoxically when the emperor changes the purple for white cloths at the moment of his death. In this case, Eusebius embeds in the purple and its colour the nuances which it acquires in the New Testament and in the contemporaneous Christian literature, as outlined above and especially in the <italic>Oratio funebris</italic> (<italic>PG</italic> 9,487,1&#x2013;4) which Gregory of Nyssa dedicated to the empress Flacilla (356&#x2013;386):</p>

<p>It should be noted that there are no references to the liturgical use of the purple (or better, of the colour purple) among Christians in the fourth century <sc>AD</sc> (cf.

Lampe 1961, 79). The bibliography on liturgical questions shows that the use of different liturgical colours in the sacred vestments of the priest according to the liturgical season or the intention of the mass is first attested to in the eight century; cf.

<p>There is a negative and categorical consideration of the purple in the <italic>Enarratio in prophetam Isaiam</italic> (3,128), attributed, albeit not unequivocally, to Basil of Caesarea: &#x2018;The purple is a symbol of deceit, for it conceals the natural colour and makes shine its own splendour in those gleaming in appearance but hiding the evil in their depth&#x2019; (translation by the author). Basilius&#x2019; <italic>Sermones de moribus a Symeone Metaphrasta collecti</italic> (<italic>PG</italic> 32, 1308) includes a passage, proceeding from the dubious <italic>Enarratio in prophetam Isaiam</italic> (3,111), in which Basilius says that a true ruler is to be recognised not through external symbols as purple, cloak or diadem but because he possesses &#x2018;the ruler&#x2019;s virtue&#x2019; (&#x03C4;&#x1F74;&#x03BD; &#x1F00;&#x03C1;&#x03C7;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x1F74;&#x03BD; &#x1F00;&#x03C1;&#x03B5;&#x03C4;&#x03AE;&#x03BD;).</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Julian wrote his <italic>Symposium</italic> or <italic>Kronia</italic>, subtitled <italic>The Caesars</italic>,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140001"><sup>1</sup></xref> during the Cronus festivities, in December 362.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140002"><sup>2</sup></xref> In the religious context of the <italic>Saturnalia</italic>, the emperor proposes his interlocutor, most likely his friend Salu(s)tius,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140003"><sup>3</sup></xref> to celebrate the feast by telling him a &#x2018;myth&#x2019; (306B). Julian aspires to telling a ludic myth (<italic>en paidi&#x00E2;s merei</italic>) but one that contains a serious lesson, like Plato, &#x201C;who also often conveyed a serious lesson in his myths&#x201D;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140004"><sup>4</sup></xref> (306BC). According to Julian, the story was told to him by the god Hermes (306C). Therefore, despite the humorous tone, some significant statements are also to be expected.</p>
<p><italic>The Caesars</italic> recounts a banquet and a competition of Roman emperors before the gods so that they may decide who has been the best ruler.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140005"><sup>5</sup></xref> As the host, Romulus-Quirinus seats the gods on their celestial thrones.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140006"><sup>6</sup></xref> From Julius Caesar to Constantine and his sons, around forty Caesars are presented (308D&#x2013;316A) with ironic remarks by Silenus, a grotesque character. The combination of humour and profundity in his dialogues sounds similar to the voice of Socrates in the Platonic dialogues.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140007"><sup>7</sup></xref> Following that opening presentation, several gods propose candidates. The candidates are asked to relate their exploits and to explain the reasons that guided their actions in life. The gods proclaim Marcus Aurelius the victor. However, there is no exaltation of the winner nor celebration of the triumph, instead, Zeus suggests all the contestants choose a patron god. Everyone succeeds in doing so except Constantine. He and his sons, persecuted by the gods of revenge for their impiety and their crimes, are ultimately saved by Claudius (Gothicus) and (Constantius) Chlorus, their ancestors. The myth makes an abrupt return to the present when Hermes addresses Julian promising him his father Mithras&#x2019; guidance and support (336C).</p>
<p><italic>The Caesars</italic> is a complex work that has given rise to a particularly extensive bibliography addressing a range of specific aspects of the text.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140008"><sup>8</sup></xref> With regards to the purpose of the work, most scholars are of the view that <italic>The Caesars</italic> is a political-religious reflection on the Roman past. The genre of satire enables ruthless mockery on the author&#x2019;s part and frees him from the constraints of fidelity to the historical record. Thus, Julian criticises the vices of his ancestors, especially those of Constantine, whom he vituperates for the murder of his relatives and his allegiance to Christianity.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140009"><sup>9</sup></xref> In the final analysis, <italic>The Caesars</italic> is an account of Julian&#x2019;s religious faith and of the human ideal that stems from it.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140010"><sup>10</sup></xref></p>
<p>Nevertheless, little critical attention has been paid to the fact that Julian presents <italic>The Caesars</italic> as a &#x2018;myth&#x2019;, &#x2018;an invention of Hermes&#x2019;, where the reader must trace the lines between truth and fiction: &#x201C;but whether you should call mine an invention of Hermes (<italic>plasma Hermo&#x00FB;</italic>) &#x2026; whether it is really true or a mixture of truth and fiction, the upshot, as the saying is, will decide&#x201D; (306C&#x2013;7A). What might this sort of riddle mean?</p>
<p>Following the Iamblichus Neo-Platonic tradition, Julian believed that &#x2018;myths&#x2019; were intended to express the deepest and most serious truths of philosophy, especially those that deal with divine affairs. Although myths composed by Julian resemble those by Platonists,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140011"><sup>11</sup></xref> his idea of myths must be understood in a particular religious context,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140012"><sup>12</sup></xref> shared by his partner.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140013"><sup>13</sup></xref></p>
<p>Julian had set out a manifesto for myth as a divine artefact desired by the gods in <italic>To the Cynic Heracleios</italic> (March 362). According to him, myths are unlikely fictions that are not to be taken literally; rather, myths must be teased out until their hidden meaning is revealed.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140014"><sup>14</sup></xref> Myths were to be read by those, mere children in age or intelligence, who are incapable of reaching a higher form of knowledge.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140015"><sup>15</sup></xref> Julian himself offered an example of &#x2018;good use of myths&#x2019;, proposing an autobiographical myth:<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140016"><sup>16</sup></xref> &#x2018;A certain rich man had numerous flocks of sheep &#x2026;&#x2019; Constantine was the rich man who, being eager to increase his wealth further, disregarded the Empire, neglected the education of his offspring and disavowed the gods. Father Zeus gave to Helios the task of bringing up Julian, the rich man&#x2019;s nephew. As a child, Julian had a vision in which Hermes told him that he was the son of Helios and Athena, and that one day he would replace his cousin Constantius as the legitimate heir of the dynasty. His duty was to purify the house of his forefathers who had fallen into lives of atheism and debauchery. Julian subjected himself to the divine will and when he grew up he was initiated into the mysteries of Helios, and everything happened as had been foretold (227C&#x2013;234C). The purpose of this parable was to show that Constantine and his sons had offended the gods, and the Empire was entrusted to his nephew Julian by the will of the gods, that Julian&#x2019;s main genealogy was that of Helios, and that his mission was to purify the dynasty of his predecessors by restoring pagan worship.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140017"><sup>17</sup></xref></p>
<p>Therefore the first aim of this paper is to read <italic>The Caesars</italic> as a &#x2018;myth&#x2019; in Julian&#x2019;s sense of the term in search of the &#x2018;divine truths&#x2019; contained in it in the light of the other autobiographical myth to be found in his <italic>To the Cynic Heracleios</italic>. This approach is based on a close reading of the text, particularly of the section dealing with the competition (316A&#x2013;336C), which contains most of the dialogues of Silenus and the gods with the competing emperors, which constitutes the core of the myth.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the classification of emperors as good or bad was a common topos of fourth century historiography and panegyrics,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140018"><sup>18</sup></xref> as was comparing the sitting emperor with his predecessors. Indeed, the emperors also played this game of emulation in the way they presented themselves. My argument here, and the second point of the paper, is that the background of the competition is &#x2018;the question of models&#x2019; in a twofold approach: the emulation of gods and of men. The Roman emperors who strove to imitate one another and, in particular Alexander, are ridiculed, whereas those who endeavoured to emulate the gods are praised.</p>

<title>Roman Emperors and Alexander</title>
<p>A significant number of emperors, a &#x201C;gallery of monsters and fools,&#x201D;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140019"><sup>19</sup></xref> are presented in the first part of <italic>The Caesars</italic> (308D&#x2013;316A), which claims to outline the history of the Roman Empire. There is only one exception in the hall of shame &#x2013; Claudius Gothicus. &#x201C;All the gods &#x2026; admiring his greatness of soul (<italic>megalopsych&#x00ED;a</italic>) granted the empire to his descendants, since they thought it just that the posterity of such a lover of his country (<italic>philop&#x00E1;tridos andr&#x00F3;s</italic>) should rule as long as possible&#x201D; (313D). All history of the Roman emperors can be summed up in widespread criticism and a praise of Claudius, worshiper of Helios and supposed founder of the second Flavian dynasty,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140020"><sup>20</sup></xref> who receives the blessing of the gods and the guarantee that his descendants will endure in time, due to the goodness of their original ancestor.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140021"><sup>21</sup></xref></p>
<p>Once the presentation is complete, but before the gods have selected those Roman emperors who are going to compete, Heracles argues that <italic>his</italic> Alexander be included, convinced that he will eclipse them all (316AB). Then Silenus mocks Quirinus, the organiser of the meeting: &#x201C;See now whether all these Romans can match this one Greek.&#x201D; Quirinus tries to defend his own, even though, inwardly, he is afraid that Alexander will steal their thunder:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>&#x201C;By Zeus,&#x201D; retorted Quirinus, &#x201C;I consider that many of them are as good as he! It is true that my descendants have admired him so much that they hold that he alone of all foreign generals is worthy to be styled &#x2018;the Great.&#x2019; But it does not follow that they think him greater than their own heroes; which may be due to national prejudice (<italic>philaut&#x00ED;a</italic>), but again they may be right. However, that we shall very soon find out by examining these men.&#x201D; Even as he spoke Quirinus was blushing, and was evidently extremely anxious on behalf of his descendants and feared that they might come off with the second prize (Jul. <italic>Caes</italic>. 316BC).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The admiration of the Roman emperors for Alexander is a standard topos in the <italic>basilikos logos</italic>, and figures in various contributions by different emperors in <italic>The Caesars</italic>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140022"><sup>22</sup></xref> Quirinus voices what Julian thinks, that the Roman emperors measure themselves against Alexander, but are incapable of acknowledging his superiority; <italic>philaut&#x00ED;a</italic> &#x2013; love of one&#x2019;s own &#x2013; prevents them from doing so.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140023"><sup>23</sup></xref> The dialectical confrontation between Julius Caesar and Alexander is a good example of this dynamic. Julian draws on a number of episodes in Plutarch&#x2019;s <italic>Parallel Lives</italic>. Proud and arrogant, Caesar argues that his achievements are superior to any of Alexander&#x2019;s deeds, while Alexander asserts his superiority over Caesar by claiming that the latter was a mere imitator:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>O Jupiter and ye other gods, how long must I endure in silence the insolence of this man? There is, as you see, no limit to his praise of himself or his abuse of me. It would have better become him perhaps to refrain from both, since both are alike insupportable, but especially from disparaging my conduct, the more since he imitated it. But he has arrived at such a pitch of impudence that he dares to ridicule the model of his own exploits. Nay, Caesar, you ought to have remembered those tears you shed on hearing of the monuments that had been consecrated to my glorious deeds (322BC).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thus, the rivalry between Julius Caesar, both insolent and ridiculous in his extravagant self-praise and his attempts to emulate Alexander, and the latter, the truly brave Greek conqueror, illustrates the desire among Roman emperors to measure themselves and their achievements against others, especially Alexander.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140024"><sup>24</sup></xref></p>
<p>In contrast, Alexander describes his rivalry with other men, but speaks of admiring and following in the footsteps of the gods alone: &#x201C;Achilles my ancestor I strove to rival, but Heracles I ever admired and followed, so far as a mere man may follow in the footsteps of a god&#x201D; (Jul. <italic>Caes</italic>. 325A). Early in the competition, the Greek hero states that gods, not men, should be role models in life, and following in the footsteps of the gods proves to be the key to Marcus Aurelius&#x2019; victory in the end.</p>
<p>Finally, Alexander defends Greek superiority over the Romans; the former were subdued only in a time of decline and disorder:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Well then, if in the old age, as one may say, of Greece, you were barely able to reduce not the whole nation but an insignificant state which was hardly heard of when Greece was in her prime, what would have happened to you if you had had to contend against the Greeks when they were in full vigour and united? (Jul. <italic>Caes</italic>. 324BC).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Through Alexander, Julian defends Greek superiority over the Romans. However, even though none of the other candidates surpasses Alexander&#x2019;s martial virtues, he will not be awarded first place because of his lack of restraint.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140025"><sup>25</sup></xref> Marcus Aurelius, a Roman emperor of philhellenic education and taste, is proclaimed the winner. Both were Julian&#x2019;s former models of emperor:<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140026"><sup>26</sup></xref></p>
<disp-quote>
<p>There was a time when I believed that I ought to try to rival men who have been most distinguished for excellence, Alexander, for instance, or Marcus; but I shivered at the thought and was seized with terror lest I should fail entirely to come up to the courage of the former, and should not make even the least approach to the latter&#x2019;s perfect virtue (Jul. <italic>Letter to Themistius</italic> 253AB).</p>

<title>Competing Models: Victory, Wisdom and Pleasure</title>
<p>When the time comes to choose the contestants,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140027"><sup>27</sup></xref> the gods present their candidates. Hermes calls on Caesar, Octavian, and Trajan as the greatest warriors. Cronus asks for the participation of Marcus Aurelius on account of his being a philosopher (317B). Lastly, Dionysus requests the presence of Constantine, &#x201C;a man not unwarlike but a slave to pleasure and enjoyment&#x201D; (<italic>hedon&#x00E9; kai ap&#x00F3;lausis</italic>) (318A). As though opening the Olympic Games, Hermes summons those who set victory, wisdom, or pleasure as their goal in life (319A). However, the competition is not the same for all three life-ambitions; rather, Julian&#x2019;s principle that exploits must be accompanied by virtues also applies.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140028"><sup>28</sup></xref> Thus the candidates must first present their deeds and then the intentions that governed their lives (318B).</p>
<p>In the first round, Julius Caesar, Alexander, Octavian, Trajan, and Constantine boast of their conquests with large and wordy explanations while Marcus Aurelius refuses to describe his achievements, claiming that the gods already know of them and will reward him for them. His approach produces silent admiration among the gods and even from Silenus (328C). That Marcus Aurelius wins the favour of the gods in this phase, not because of his philosophical ideas but because, despite being a great warrior, he resists the temptation to seek praise and glory is very significant and has not thus far been highlighted.</p>
<p>The competitors must then cite the purpose that has guided their actions in life. By taunting them, Silenus succeeds in drawing out their vices: Alexander&#x2019;s lack of control, even to the extreme of killing his best friend in wrath (330A, 331C); Julius Caesar&#x2019;s fondness for being first in all things, seeking power from his compatriots through flattery (331CD, 332D); Octavian&#x2019;s irreverence in inventing new gods such as Julius Caesar himself (332C, 333A); Trajan&#x2019;s lewdness in shameful pleasures (333A); and Constantine&#x2019;s eagerness to have many possessions and spend so much on satisfying his desires and those of his friends (335B). At the same time, however, Silenus&#x2019; search for faults or blame in Marcus Aurelius&#x2019; character proves fruitless (334B&#x2013;335A). Marcus Aurelius accounts for his excessive indulgence with regards to his wife and son by arguing that his attitude is inherent to human nature, and his behaviour was intended to imitate Zeus and Achilles, doing, as everbody does, nothing other than caring for his family (312B, 334B&#x2013;335A). Marcus imitates the gods even in their weaknesses. Dionysius exclaims in wonder: &#x201C;For in my opinion he is a man, to quote Simonides, &#x2018;four-square and made without a flaw.&#x2019;&#x201D;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140029"><sup>29</sup></xref></p>

<label>4.4</label>
<title>Marcus Aurelius, the Victor</title>
<p>From the very moment in which Marcus Aurelius entered the competition, he stood out because of his sober physical appearance and the depth of his soul, a living image of asceticism and temperance:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Accordingly, Marcus was summoned and came in looking excessively dignified and showing the effect of his studies in the expression of his eyes and his lined brows. His aspect was unutterably beautiful from the very fact that he was careless of his appearance and unadorned by art; for he wore a very long beard, his dress was plain and sober, and from lack of nourishment his body was very shining and transparent, like light most pure and stainless (Jul. <italic>Caes.</italic> 317C).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Asked by Hermes what he thought was the noblest ambition in his life, &#x201C;in a low voice Marcus answered modestly, &#x2018;to imitate the gods&#x2019;&#x201D; (333C). However, Silenus would not settle for that laconic answer: &#x201C;tell me what did you think was really meant by &#x2018;imitating the gods.&#x2019; &#x2018;Having the fewest possible needs and doing good to the greatest possible number.&#x2019; &#x2018;O you mean to say,&#x2019; he asked, &#x2018;that you had no needs at all?&#x2019; &#x2018;I,&#x2019; said Marcus, &#x2018;had none, but my wretched body had a few, perhaps.&#x2019;&#x201D; (334A).</p>
<p>Although it appears that Julian had found his model of emperor in Marcus Aurelius, Hunt has argued the meaning of the analogy is, in fact, the other way round:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The Marcus seen in Julian&#x2019;s <italic>Caesars</italic> is thus not &#x2013; beyond the conventional image of the philosopher-ruler &#x2013; a depiction of the second-century emperor, but a contemporary creation &#x2026; the role of Marcus in <italic>The Caesars</italic> is a projection of Julian&#x2019;s own self-identification, embodying the austere asceticism and practising piety which were the hallmarks of his own regime, and of the religious crusade over which he sought to preside. Even down to his long beard (317c) the Marcus of <italic>The Caesars</italic> is cast, not as his real self, but in the image of Julian.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140030"><sup>30</sup></xref> His part in the fable finds its ideal exemplum in Julian, and not the other way round.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140031"><sup>31</sup></xref></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This Marcus Aurelius has all the physical characteristics and moral qualities that Julian will ascribe to himself in the <italic>Misopogon</italic>: a long beard, asceticism, self-restraint (<italic>sophros&#x00FD;ne</italic>), and imitation of the gods in all aspects of life.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140032"><sup>32</sup></xref> Nevertheless, he is not formally presented by Julian as his model emperor. As will be seen later, Julian has decided not to take part in this contest of imitation and emulation among Roman emperors.</p>
<p>The gods announce the result of their vote, proclaiming Marcus Aurelius to be the winner, but there are neither solemn ceremonies nor celebrations: &#x201C;Our laws are such that the winner can be happy without the complaints of the loser&#x201D; (335C). The competition is over, but not the myth. Before finishing the match, Zeus suggests that all the contestants choose a god or, what is the same in the emulation game, look for a model for life. All do so: Alexander and Heracles; Octavian and Apollo; Marcus Aurelius is inseparable from Zeus and Cronos; Ares and Aphrodite eventually take pity on Caesar; and even Trajan, who is permitted to sit next to his idol, Alexander, whom he sees as a god. All have a patron god except for Constantine.</p>
<p>The moral of the emperors&#x2019; competition is that victory rests on virtue and the complete imitation of the gods, not of men, but that more important than any triumph is living under the patronage of a god. In all, Constantine has completely failed, as detailed below.</p>

<label>4.5</label>
<title>Constantine, the Loser</title>
<p>From the beginning, Constantine is different to the rest of participants. He is chosen for the contest because Dionysus requests the presence of &#x201C;some votary of pleasure&#x201D; (<italic>tina kai apolause&#x00F4;s erasten</italic>). The gods consider him to be an outsider, &#x201C;who does not model himself on us&#x201D; and therefore cannot enter the gods&#x2019; dwelling-place (317D). Later we are told that the pleasure to which he is enslaved is a woman, with whom Constantine is infatuated:<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140033"><sup>33</sup></xref> she &#x201C;stood at a distance from the gods near the entrance to the moon&#x201D; (329A).</p>
<p><italic>Tryphe</italic>, in Latin <italic>luxus</italic> or <italic>fastus</italic>, was a personification of an abstract concept, commonly represented in late antique iconography.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140034"><sup>34</sup></xref> It could mean &#x2018;softness,&#x2019; &#x2018;voluptuousness,&#x2019; &#x2018;magnificence,&#x2019; &#x2018;extravagance,&#x2019; &#x2018;luxury,&#x2019; &#x2018;opulence&#x2019; or &#x2018;sumptuosity.&#x2019; It was subjected to severe criticism in Greek and Roman antiquity,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140035"><sup>35</sup></xref> as a moral cause of political debacles.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140036"><sup>36</sup></xref> It was said that <italic>Tryphe</italic> could destroy the character of those who fell into her hands, not only kings and chiefs, but also honest citizens, as Julian argued in the first <italic>Encomium to Constantius</italic>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140037"><sup>37</sup></xref></p>
<p><italic>Tryphe</italic> shadows Constantine in the three scenes in which he appears. Firstly, in the account of his exploits, he was so enamoured that he had no eyes for anything else:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>He had defeated two tyrants, but, to tell the truth, one of them was untrained in war and effeminate (Maxentius), the other a poor creature and enfeebled by old age (Licinius), while both were alike odious to gods and men. Moreover his campaigns against the barbarians covered him with ridicule. For he paid them tribute, so to speak, while he gave all his attention to Pleasure, who stood at a distance from the gods near the entrance to the moon. Of her indeed he was so enamoured that he had no eyes for anything else, and cared not at all for victory<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140038"><sup>38</sup></xref> (Jul. <italic>Caes.</italic> 329A).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a stinging attack in which the narrator (i.e. Julian) strips Constantine of military success, in marked contrast to the historians of the time, who presented Constantine as a great general, victorious in battles both within and without,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140039"><sup>39</sup></xref> an emperor on whom Fortune shone,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140040"><sup>40</sup></xref> although for Aurelius Victor, Constantine&#x2019;s desire for glory,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140041"><sup>41</sup></xref> and for Eutropius, his many successes, had made him arrogant.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140042"><sup>42</sup></xref></p>
<p>Fictional Constantine tries to defend his exploits:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>In the following respects I am superior to these others: to the Macedonian in having fought against Romans, Germans and Scythians, instead of Asiatic barbarians; to Caesar and Octavian in that I did not, like them, lead a revolution against brave and good citizens, but attacked only the most cruel and wicked tyrants. As for Trajan, I should naturally rank higher on account of those same glorious exploits against the tyrants, while it would be only fair to regard me as his equal on the score of that territory which he added to the empire, and I recovered; if indeed it be not more glorious to regain than to gain. As for Marcus here by saying nothing for himself he yields precedency to all of us. (Jul. <italic>Caes.</italic> 329A).</p>
</disp-quote>

<p>His arguments are shown to be weak and easily refutable; it would appear that his arrogance and limited intelligence render him incapable of understanding the modesty of Marcus Aurelius.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140043"><sup>43</sup></xref> Julian aims to ridicule Constantine&#x2019;s overweening self-confidence,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140044"><sup>44</sup></xref> as well as his desire to compete with all the greatest emperors.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140045"><sup>45</sup></xref> Silenus mocks the insignificance of his triumphs using a proverbial expression:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>&#x201C;But Constantine,&#x201D; said Silenus, &#x201C;are you not offering us mere gardens of Adonis as exploits?&#x201D; &#x201C;What do you mean,&#x201D; he asked, &#x201C;by gardens of Adonis?&#x201D; &#x201C;I mean,&#x201D; said Silenus, &#x201C;those that women plant in pots, in honour of the lover of Aphrodite, by scraping together a little earth for a garden bed. They bloom for a little space and fade forthwith.&#x201D; At this Constantine blushed, for he realised that this was exactly his own performance. (Jul. <italic>Caes.</italic> 329CD).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the Greek tradition, &#x2018;the gardens of Adonis&#x2019; were a metaphor for the ephemeral and inconsistent.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140046"><sup>46</sup></xref> To my mind, the phrase &#x2018;they (the achievements) bloom for a little space and fade forthwith&#x2019; contains a reference of one of the symbols <italic>par excellence</italic> of Constantine&#x2019;s triumphs; the representation of Tyche-Constantinople. &#x2018;Blooming&#x2019;, or &#x2018;flourishing&#x2019; was the meaning of the epithet Anthousa with which Constantine had renamed the city of Constantinople in its consecration in May 330.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140047"><sup>47</sup></xref> With it, the emperor intended to equate Constantinople with Rome, whose epithet Flora also meaning &#x2018;the Flourishing&#x2019;, and at the same time to show the greatness of his triumphs in the city that bore his name.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140048"><sup>48</sup></xref> Silenus-Julian regards these triumphs as <italic>delusions of grandeur</italic>, which will soon wither, will soon be nothing.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140049"><sup>49</sup></xref> And it can be argued that there is an implicit wordplay on the name of Constantine&#x2019;s beloved, Tryphe-Tyche, criticising the symbol created by Constantine for his &#x2018;city of victory&#x2019;.</p>
<p>In his second scene, Constantine is also guided by Tryphe&#x2019;s principles:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>&#x201C;What was the height of your ambition?,&#x201D; Hermes asked Constantinus, &#x201C;To amass great wealth and then to spend it liberally so as to gratify my own desires and the desires of my friends.&#x201D; At this Silenus burst into a loud laugh, and said, &#x201C;If it was a banker that you wanted to be, how did you so far forget yourself as to lead the life of a pastrycook and hairdresser? Your locks and your fair favour betokened this all along, but what you say about your motives convicts you.&#x201D; Thus did Silenus sharply reprove Constantine (Jul. <italic>Caes</italic>. 335B).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Constantine&#x2019;s generosity was proverbial;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140050"><sup>50</sup></xref> ancient sources record his munificence with his soldiers, barbarians, and the people of Constantinople.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140051"><sup>51</sup></xref> Julian himself praised it in the first <italic>Encomium to Constantius</italic>:<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140052"><sup>52</sup></xref></p>
<disp-quote>
<p>When he had made his power supreme, he found that the tyrant&#x2019;s greed had worked like a drought, with the result that money was very scarce, while there were great hoards of treasure in the recesses of the palace; so he unlocked its doors and on the instant flooded the whole country with wealth, and then, in less than ten years, he founded and gave his name to a city (i.e. Constantinople) that as far surpasses all others.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>However, Julian later criticised this aspect of Constantine&#x2019;s character in <italic>To the Cynic Heracleios</italic>: a rich man who cared only about his earnings, eager to increase his own wealth by fair means or foul, so little did he care for the gods.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140053"><sup>53</sup></xref> Constantine is sharply criticised for his wastefulness and extravagance in satisfying his own whims and those of his friends. Constantine&#x2019;s response prompts insults from Silenus: &#x201C;If it was a banker that you wanted to be, how did you so far forget yourself as to lead the life of a pastrycook and hairdresser?&#x201D; Sardiello has observed that this mockery recalls passages in the <italic>Republic</italic> and the <italic>Gorgias</italic> in which Plato describes these and other trades as among the most despicable and shameful in a &#x2018;diseased State&#x2019;, concerned only with the care of the body and not of the soul. The philosopher describes holders of such roles as sycophants and scoundrels by nature.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140054"><sup>54</sup></xref></p>
<p>Silenus continues to chide Constantine: &#x201C;&#x2018;your locks and your fair favour&#x2019;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140055"><sup>55</sup></xref> betokened this all along, but what you say about your motives convicts you.&#x201D; These Homeric verses are better understood in light of the following scene:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>He (Constantine) could not discover among the gods the model of his own career, but when he caught sight of Pleasure (Tryphe) who was not far off, he ran to her. She received him tenderly and embraced him then after dressing him in raiment of many colours and otherwise making him beautiful. (336A).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In my view, this is an allegorical way of referring to renowned Constantine&#x2019;s handsomeness and making it part of his depravity. The previous insults of &#x2018;pastrycook and hairdresser,&#x2019; as well as the reference to Homeric verses on Paris, and probably the expression &#x201C;the gardens of Adonis&#x201D;,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140056"><sup>56</sup></xref> are teasing about Constantine&#x2019;s appeal and could allude to Constantine&#x2019;s representation in Apollo&#x2019;s likeness. Although in <italic>The Caesars</italic> there is no reference to it, in the <italic>To the Cynic Heracleios</italic>&#x2019; myth Helios regrets bitterly Constantine&#x2019;s departure.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140057"><sup>57</sup></xref> Here Constantine is accused of impiety and sacriledge<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140058"><sup>58</sup></xref> for having abandoned the gods, perhaps in implicit reference to Apollo, the supposed familiar cult.</p>
<p>Divine condemnation also extends to Constantine&#x2019;s sons and focuses on their impiety and the shedding of the blood of their kindred (336B), as in <italic>To the Cynic Heracleios</italic> myth (229BC). Here redemption comes from their ancestors. When Constantine and his sons are tormented by the gods of vengeance, Zeus granted them some relief because of Claudius (Gothicus) and (Constantius) Chlorus (336B). Claudius being the founder of the new Flavian dynasty to whom the gods guaranteed the empire to his descendants due to his greatness of soul and love to his homeland (313D),<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140059"><sup>59</sup></xref> and Constantius as Julian&#x2019;s grandfather (315A). Consequently, their pagan ancestors are credited with a power of intercession not unlike the saints in Christianity, to repair what Constantine and his sons had ruined.</p>

<title>A Myth on Julian&#x2019;s Dynasty</title>
<p>The story has an unexpected turn, when Julian reproduces Hermes&#x2019; words at the end of the story:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>&#x201C;As for thee,&#x201D; Hermes said to me (i.e. Julian), &#x201C;I have granted thee the knowledge of thy father Mithras. Do thou keep his commandments, and thus secure for thyself a cable and sure anchorage throughout thy life, and when thou must depart from the world thou canst with good hopes adopt him as thy guardian god&#x201D; (Jul. <italic>Caes.</italic> 336C).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Narration locates Julian beyond the competition and rivalry between emperors, reciving a divine message; the divine protection in this life and in the future will be guaranteed if he continues under Mithras&#x2019; guidance. In the previous myth, after Constantine&#x2019;s departure,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140060"><sup>60</sup></xref> Helios entrusts Julian, his new prot&#x00E9;g&#x00E9;, with a mission:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Know that a mortal frame was given to thee that thou mightest discharge these duties. For we desire, out of respect for thy ancestors to cleanse the house of thy forefathers (Jul. <italic>Or.</italic> 7.234C).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The myth of <italic>The Caesars</italic> could be said to carry out Helios&#x2019; command to &#x201C;purify the dynasty&#x201D; by debunking Constantine&#x2019;s triumphs, symbols, and fame and denouncing the evil that Constantine and his sons had caused to the Empire.</p>
<p>To conclude, Hermes&#x2019; account on the Roman emperors becomes a &#x2018;myth on Julian&#x2019;s dynasty&#x2019; containing &#x2018;divine truths&#x2019; which amplify and extend the previous in <italic>To the Cynic Heracleios</italic>. The lineage to which Julian supposedly belonged is the blessed by the gods, who guaranteed its continuity, as long as his descendants were worshipers of the gods. The focus on emulation of men and gods enables Julian to ridicule traditional &#x201C;good emperors&#x201D;, but particularly his uncle Constantine. Through the imitation game, Julian accuses him not only of having abandoned the gods but also having corrupted the dynasty and the Empire. The initiate into the mystery of Helios-Mithras recounts to the Empire of his human and divine genealogy in a language of myths.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN140061"><sup>61</sup></xref></p>

<title>Introduction: Minor Stars in the Wake of Julian</title>
<p>One of the key features of Roman emperorship<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150000"><sup>*</sup></xref> relies on its temporal dimension. This can be condensed into the importance of being Augustus; of being inserted as a ruler in the everlasting history of the <italic>Urbs</italic>, regardless of by what means that Augustus became the ruler of Rome; how exactly he met the standards of a perfect prince; or how noble his death happened to be. Not surprisingly, the Roman historiographical tradition from the Julio-Claudians considers an emperor&#x2019;s accession and decease as moments marked by doom and pointed at by cosmic forces.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150001"><sup>1</sup></xref> In the fourth century, however, imperial images acquire distinctive and significant nuances. After Constantine, Christian views added to the traditional ideas new religious arguments for legitimacy, new limits of power and new criteria for judging an exemplary emperor. Within this framework, the emperor Julian certainly stands out as a singular figure in that period, not only as a result of his determined opposition to the new ideas, but also because his literary work makes it easier to look into the author&#x2019;s personal opinion on emperorship.</p>
<p>Julian&#x2019;s failed reign gave rise to both a markedly negative and a favourable narrative in the years following his death. Belonging to the latter line, Ammianus Marcellinus&#x2019; work presents Julian as its main character and imperial paradigm, and develops the subtlest narrative of emperorship in Latin during the fourth century.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150002"><sup>2</sup></xref> As literary explorations in recent years have emphasised,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150003"><sup>3</sup></xref> Ammianus&#x2019; Julian is an artistic construct, detached from the image dominant in earlier Greek sources and intended for a western Latin-speaking audience, or at least for a Roman posterity.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150004"><sup>4</sup></xref> While intertextual studies have properly placed the <italic>Res Gestae</italic> in Roman historiographical tradition,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150005"><sup>5</sup></xref> for their part, narratological examinations<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150006"><sup>6</sup></xref> have enabled a significant advance in our understanding of Julian&#x2019;s portrayal and Ammianus&#x2019; authorial voice. However, both approaches still offer great potential for new advancements. One of these grounds unmapped for narratologists is the implicit presence of Julian in sections of the <italic>Res Gestae</italic> free from the dominating and explicit presence of the leading figure, such as the last six books, the narrative sections devoted to secondary characters, or the assorted digressions.</p>
<p>The purpose of this contribution is to study the interaction between authorial persona and idea of emperorship in four excursuses of Ammianus&#x2019; work that elucidate natural phenomena:<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150007"><sup>7</sup></xref> the explanation on eclipses in 20.3.2&#x2013;12, after Ursicinus&#x2019; disgrace; the comments on rainbows in 20.11.25&#x2013;30, after Constantius&#x2019; failure in his Eastern campaign; a brief comment in 25.2.5&#x2013;6 on the shooting star Julian saw his last night; and two paragraphs concerning comets in 25.10.2&#x2013;3, which precede Jovian&#x2019;s death. In three of the four cases, some of the characters involved in the narrative and the narrator had interpreted natural accidents as cosmic warnings for Constantius or Jovian, two minor stars in the wake of Julian, as their presentation becomes closely interwoven with that of Julian, but who are clearly secondary in comparison with him.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150008"><sup>8</sup></xref></p>
<p>It is important to note that these four passages are not the only authorial comments on phenomena with proleptic sense in the <italic>Res Gestae</italic>. Some of Ammianus&#x2019; scientific digressions seem not to have an overt connection with the narrative, while others are more or less explicitly referred to foreknowledge and fate. This is the case in 17.7.9&#x2013;14,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150009"><sup>9</sup></xref> the section on the nature, causes and varieties of earthquakes, the explanation of the tsunami in 26.10.15&#x2013;19,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150010"><sup>10</sup></xref> as well as the excursus on the <italic>genius tutelaris</italic> of Constantius in 21.14.3&#x2013;5.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150011"><sup>11</sup></xref> Thus, the digressions under scrutiny in this study are significant parts of a major theme in Ammianus&#x2019; design, in which omens, signs and divination are a noticeable part of the emperors&#x2019; account.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150012"><sup>12</sup></xref> However, these passages significantly share a common pattern that can be revealed by a literary analysis pointing at a broader scheme from the part of the author. Although divination and foresight have long ago been researched from the point of view of Ammianus&#x2019; beliefs,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150013"><sup>13</sup></xref> only recently has the narrative purpose of omens attracted attention: as prolepses or, less frequently, as analepses, omens move characters in a particular direction, and can likewise intensify the dramatic tension of the story.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150014"><sup>14</sup></xref></p>
<p>Certainly, the historian gives the greatest importance to Julian&#x2019;s ambiguous response to omens, from the time of his accession to his death in the course of the Persian campaign. So, in 21.1.1&#x2013;6, Julian made the decision of openly declaring war to Constantius after being informed through presages of the imminent death of his cousin: 6. <italic>Acuebat autem incendebatque eius cupiditatem pacatis iam Galliis | incessere ultro Constantium coniciens eum per uaticinandi praesagia multa, quae callebat, et somnia e uita protinus excessurum</italic>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150015"><sup>15</sup></xref> Subsequently, in 21.1.7&#x2013;14, Ammianus inserts a well-known excursus on divination that contributes to the main character&#x2019;s portrayal,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150016"><sup>16</sup></xref> since the narrator wants his report to cope with malicious interpretations of the Caesar&#x2019;s attitude to the matter: <italic>Et quoniam erudito et studioso cognitionum omnium principi | maleuoli praenoscendi futura prauas artes assignant, aduertendum est breuiter, unde sapienti uiro hoc quoque accedere poterit, doctrinae genus haud leue</italic> (7).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150017"><sup>17</sup></xref> Ultimately, Julian&#x2019;s attitude to omens and his inability to recognise exempla from the past become the two most prominent reasons for his failure in Persia, but, as Ross rightly explains, both traits are deeply rooted in the Roman tradition and bring Julian&#x2019;s outcome under an essentially Roman spotlight. Until the emperor&#x2019;s deathbed, when he plainly acknowledges the strength of premonitory signs and the authority of the Etruscan discipline, the narrator keeps the narratee in suspense about the protagonist&#x2019;s ability to understand his own fate:<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150018"><sup>18</sup></xref></p>
<disp-quote>
<p>25.3.19: &#x201C;nec fateri pudebit: interiturum me ferro dudum didici fide fatidica praecinente. ideoque sempiternum ueneror numen, quod non clandestinis insidiis nec longa morborum asperitate uel damnatorum fine decedo, sed in medio cursu florentium gloriarum hunc merui clarum ex mundo digressum. aequo enim iudicio iuxta timidus est et ignauus, qui, cum non oportet, mori desiderat, et qui refugiat, cum sit opportunum.&#x201D;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150019"><sup>19</sup></xref></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>After this declaration, the reader can reconstruct prior allusions to Julian&#x2019;s understanding of prefatory signs that Ammianus had held in ambiguous terms, and that disclose their full tragic irony, as is the case in 25.2.4&#x2013;7, when the Emperor states that he will never sacrifice to Mars again. In other words, the allusions to how fate accomplishes and to how the characters do or do not grasp diverse clues about their destiny gradually depicts Julian, whose great tragedy is disclosed as the &#x201C;chronicle of a death foretold&#x201D; from the first hints at the beginning of the Persian campaign until its disastrous end.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150020"><sup>20</sup></xref> As presented by Ammianus, Julian&#x2019;s death proves even more meaningful when weighed again the reactions of other imperial characters in similar circumstances. In summary, proleptic and analeptic comments on destiny, among which warning signs provided by the physical world play a major role, create internal coherence in the progressive presentation of Julian and of Ammianus&#x2019; general idea of emperorship.</p>
<p>Within that broad framework of the Julianic narrative, the enquiry of this paper focuses on three digressive sections about eclipses, rainbows, and comets, which are treated respectively in sections 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4. Those passages are, nonetheless, better understood in comparison with the comments of the shooting star that preceded Julian&#x2019;s death, as section 5.5 will show. Finally, the reciprocal evocation of these digressions will disclose general trends in Ammianus&#x2019; construction of his narrative persona, the characterisation of Constantius and Jovian in contrast with Julian, and ultimately the idea of emperorship in the Latin West during the fourth century.</p>

<title>Eclipses of Reason: Amm. 20.3.1&#x2013;12.</title>
<p>After describing Ursicinus&#x2019; fall in 20.2, Ammianus&#x2019; narrative recounts in 20.3.1&#x2013;12 some celestial phenomena that occurred in the Eastern part of the Empire:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>(1) Eodem tempore per eoos tractus caelum subtextum caligine cernebatur obscura et a primo aurorae exortu ad usque meridiem intermicabant iugiter stellae; hisque terroribus accedebat, quod, cum lux caelestis operiretur e mundi conspectu penitus lance abrepta, defecisse diutius solem pauidae mentes hominum aestimabant: primo attenuatum in lunae corniculantis effigiem, deinde in speciem auctum semenstrem posteaque in integrum restitutum.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150021"><sup>21</sup></xref></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is far from clear that at this point the <italic>Res Gestae</italic> rigorously respects the actual chronology of events, since the narration suggests that the darkening takes place at the same time as Julian winters in Paris, in the last months of 360. However, the only eclipse in the northern hemisphere that year occurred much earlier, on 28 August. Most likely the historian adjusted the sequence of events to the narrative function of this section, using the event itself and the excursus to highlight the decline of Constantius and the rise of Julian.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150022"><sup>22</sup></xref></p>
<p>The wording in 20.3.1 implies that a weather blackout occurs first, causing terror in human minds, and subsequently an eclipse becomes visible: <italic>hisque terroribus accedebat, quod &#x2026; defecisse diutius solem pauidae mentes hominum aestimabant</italic>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150023"><sup>23</sup></xref> Therefore, the cosmic portent seems to have happened in two different phases. However, the historian might have conflated two different situations and added picturesque details of his own, or even decoded the perception of the phenomena in two successive moments. Then the narrator details in eleven paragraphs (2&#x2013;12) the astronomical coincidences in which such phenomena take place:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>(2) quod alias non euenit ita perspicue, nisi cum post inaequales cursus intermenstruum lunae ad idem reuocatur initium certis temporum interuallis, id est cum in domicilio eiusdem signi tota reperitur luna sub sole, liniamentis obiecta rectissimis, atque in his paulisper consistit minutis, quae geometrica ratio partium partes appellat &#x2026;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150024"><sup>24</sup></xref></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This description, traditionally counted among Ammianus&#x2019; scientific digressions,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150025"><sup>25</sup></xref> has attracted significant attention from scholars exhaustively dealing with its sources, structure, tradition, style, and inconsistencies.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150026"><sup>26</sup></xref> However, a narratological approach can also distinguish three different points of view highlighted by Ammianus&#x2019; description. First, from the point of view of the timorous human minds, whose fears are unjustified, since a proper scientific learning allows to realise that eclipses obey cosmic laws: <italic>hisque terroribus accedebat, quod &#x2026; defecisse diutius solem pauidae mentes hominum aestimabant &#x2026; quod alias non euenit ita perspicue, nisi &#x2026;</italic></p>
<p>Second, from the narrator&#x2019;s persona, which is built up as an authoritative category through the excursus&#x2019; boastful erudition. In this regard, it is relevant that Ammianus drops the comment in 3.4 that Ptolemy has explained the moon&#x2019;s nodes in a learnt and elegant way (<italic>scienter et decore</italic>),<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150027"><sup>27</sup></xref> which suggests that he has weighed up and digested different <italic>doxai</italic> (8: <italic>opiniones uariae collegerunt</italic>). Greek technical terms scattered along the explanation (4: <italic>anabibazontas</italic> &#x2026; <italic>katabibazontas ekleiptikous syndesmous</italic>; 9: <italic>synodos</italic>; 10: <italic>menoeides</italic> &#x2026; <italic>dichomenis</italic>; 11: <italic>apokrousin</italic>) also contribute to the general impression of erudite expertise. However, Ammianus has seemingly derived his account mostly from Latin sources easily recognisable for those moderately proficient in the matter. They are mainly from Cicero,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150028"><sup>28</sup></xref> to whom he turns for the idea of paragraph 12 on the relatively tiny size of the Earth in comparison with the universe, and for most of the vocabulary used.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150029"><sup>29</sup></xref> In spite of these efforts from the part of the author, the digression is not easily intelligible, partly because of the geocentric model adopted, partly due to Ammianus&#x2019; inaccurate rendering of his sources.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150030"><sup>30</sup></xref> In any case, the digression concludes in paragraph 12 insisting on that there is no general consensus on how the phenomena are to be explained and that their appearance is deceptive for those who ignore qualified explanations, since human ability is sometimes imperfect: <italic>Quod autem solem nunc in aethere, nunc in mundo inferiore cursare praediximus, sciendum est siderea corpora, quantum ad uniuersitatem pertinet, nec occidere nec oriri, sed ita uideri nostris obtutibus &#x2026; aliquotiens humana uisione languente &#x2026; uerum ad instituta iam reuertamur</italic>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150031"><sup>31</sup></xref></p>
<p>Third, from the point of view of the central character alluded to by the happening of the eclipse. Traditionally, ancient historiography brings in eclipses as a motif that cosmically reflects a change of fortune for a main individual, such as the death of a king or the collapse of a kingdom.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150032"><sup>32</sup></xref> In this vein, some have interpreted that the eclipse cosmically reflects Ursicinus&#x2019; downfall,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150033"><sup>33</sup></xref> which will not last indefinitely, and implies that Julian, as a new sun, will rise again in the following chapters. In all likelihood, however, the eclipse refers to the future, prophetically preparing Constantius&#x2019; fatal end (21.15) and Julian&#x2019;s accession, which is dealt with in chapter 20.4, and which happened after Ursicinus&#x2019; disgrace, as reported in 20.2. Therefore, the excursus bridges preceding and subsequent chapters and smooths the diegetic flow, regardless of what the partition of the text into chapters decanted in the textual tradition could suggest. Apparently, Ursicinus&#x2019; deposition and Julian&#x2019;s proclamation have little in common, except for Constantius&#x2019; reactions to events and omens present both in chapters 20.2 and 20.4.</p>
<p>In fact, Ammianus narrates in 20.2 the fall from grace that eventually led Ursicinus to renouncing the public life. After the disaster of Amida, the <italic>magister peditum</italic> appears in court, where his detractors manipulate Constantius against him (always available to those who plotted traps), and is left in front of an unfair trial. Shocked by the unmerited charge of being responsible for the military disaster, Ursicinus bursts out and speaks his mind freely, to the point of reproaching the emperor for being a toy of the court&#x2019;s eunuchs. According to Ammianus&#x2019; text, Ursicinus&#x2019; words were a kind of omen:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>20.2.4: Qua iniquitate percitus qui audiebatur &#x201C;etsi me,&#x201D; inquit, &#x201C;despicit imperator, negotii tamen est magnitudo, ut non nisi iudicio principis nosci possit et uindicari; sciat tamen uelut quodam praesagio, quod, dum maeret super his, quae apud Amidam gesta amendata didicit fide dumque ad spadonum arbitrium trahitur, defrustandae Mesopotamiae proximo uere ne ipse quidem cum exercitus robore omni | opitulari poterit praesens.&#x201D;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150034"><sup>34</sup></xref></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The phrasing <italic>quodam praesagio</italic> is reported by editions as part of Ursicinus&#x2019; direct speech, and at first sight seem out of place on the lips of the master of the infantry, who could not anticipate future events in the East in a proper sense.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150035"><sup>35</sup></xref> So, that remark can be interpreted as an elaboration from the part of Ammianus, who might have used Ursicinus as a &#x201C;metaliterary commentator,&#x201D;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150036"><sup>36</sup></xref> so that the comment characterises Constantius&#x2019; prior and later irresoluteness. It cannot be ruled out, however, that the remark was an authorial interpolation pointing out the ominous character of Ursicinus&#x2019; outburst in itself,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150037"><sup>37</sup></xref> since the end of chapter is focused from Constantius&#x2019; response.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150038"><sup>38</sup></xref> He angers outrageously, overlooks the matter, prohibits that the experts in divination elucidate what was over his knowledge, and dismisses Ursicinus from the army:<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150039"><sup>39</sup></xref></p>
<disp-quote>
<p>20.2.5: Relatis adiectisque cum interpretatione maligna compluribus iratus ultra modum Constantius nec discusso negotio nec patefieri, quae scientiam eius latebant, permissis appetitum calumniis deposita militia digredi iussit ad otium Agilone ad eius locum immodico saltu promoto ex Gentilium Scutariorum tribuno.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150040"><sup>40</sup></xref></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>At any rate, whether <italic>quodam praesagio</italic> has actually been uttered by Ursicinus or intercalated by Ammianus, the emperor&#x2019;s wrongful response to omens becomes particularly noteworthy in the narrative thread. Constantius misunderstood that Ursicinus&#x2019; rash eruption mentioning a disastrous, but feasible, course of events had been a sort of omen of what would happen in Mesopotamia, and he was likewise incapable of grasping the cosmic warning provided by the various dark signs and an eclipse occurring in the eastern territories.</p>
<p>The &#x201C;eclipse&#x201D; of Constantius&#x2019; reason, his blindness to foresights of any kind, is ironically continued in the first paragraphs of 20.4. The emperor reacts to Julian&#x2019;s moves with envy and fear, sending Decentius with the order of dispatching auxiliary and select troops to the East and deducting resources which could assist Julian in Gaul.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>20.4.1-2: Properantem Constantium orienti ferre suppetias turbando prope diem excursibus Persicis, ut perfugae concinentes exploratoribus indicabant, urebant Iuliani uirtute.

</disp-quote>
<p>Eventually these units are responsible for Julian&#x2019;s proclamation as Augustus in Paris (4.14). The following chapter (20.5) details Julianus&#x2019; reaction to his troops&#x2019; initiative in Paris, before the narrative thread briefly diverges on war affairs in the East, namely how Sapor attacks and conquers Singara (20.6) and Bezabde (20.7), and how he fails in his attempt with Virta. Then the focus (20.8) moves to Julian&#x2019;s letter to Constantius explaining the events in Gaul,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150042"><sup>42</sup></xref> and to Constantius&#x2019; reaction by means of an edict (20.9): he decides to lead the army against the Persians and commands Julian to content himself with the title of Caesar. The imperial edict was read before the legions assembled in Paris, who rejected it outright, cheering again Julian as Augustus. After a succinct chapter (20.10) on Julian&#x2019;s new military achievements around the Rhine, the last section of the book (20.11) deals with Constantius&#x2019; unsuccessful attempt of laying siege to Bezabde, a failure commented on using a digressive section on rainbows that is treated in the next section.</p>

<title>After the Storm Comes a Rainbow: Amm. 20.11.26&#x2013;30.</title>
<p>Once the long and ineffective blockade of the town is dramatically depicted (20.11.5&#x2013;25), the narrator draws the attention to how the events unfolded differently from what the Emperor had hoped for. In fact, his plans were ruined by atmospheric accidents that caused panic among the troops and were followed by a rainbow, a phenomenon briefly explained in five paragraphs (26&#x2013;30), before the story returns to Constantius&#x2019; inner reaction in 31:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>20.11.24-31: quod secus atque rebatur euenit. (25) cum enim remissius pugnaretur, umente caelo undantes nubes cum tenebris aduenere minacibus assiduisque imbribus ita immaduerat solum, ut luti glutinosa mollities per eas regiones pinguissimi caespitis omnia perturbaret. et super his iugi fragore tonitrua fulgoraque mentes hominum pauidas perterrebant.

Super his urebat eius anxiam mentem, quod uelut patefacta ianua diuitis domus | irritus propositi reuertetur.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150043"><sup>43</sup></xref></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>So, this digressive section additionally characterises Constantius&#x2019; imperial limited aptitudes, more precisely his clumsiness in coping with warnings provided by the cosmos.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150044"><sup>44</sup></xref> It is noteworthy that the chapter is narrated from the same three points of view as in the case of the eclipses&#x2019; digression. First, it is viewed from the fearful human minds (<italic>mentes pauidae</italic>), also mentioned in 20.3.1, now terrified because of thunder and lightning: <italic>et super his iugi fragore tonitrua fulgoraque mentes hominum pauidas perterrebant</italic>. Although the formula of transition is much clearer than in the excursus on eclipses (<italic>quae species unde ita figurari est solita, expositio breuis ostendet</italic>), other coincidences of narrative strategy are remarkable. Ammianus decodes the account in successive stages in a way that also recalls the gradual supply of information in 3.1: initially, torrential rains cover the ground with mud; subsequently (<italic>super his</italic>), thunder and lightning take place; and finally, rainbows were added to the other phenomena happening (<italic>accedebant arcus caelestes conspectus assidui</italic>). Likewise, the drive for explaining the natural phenomenon is in this case the misperception by ignorant minds: <italic>rationes physicae &#x2026; cuius species, quantum mortalis oculus contuetur &#x2026; ut terrenae existimant mentes &#x2026; Arbitrantur alii tunc iridis formam rebus apparere mundanis, cum &#x2026;</italic></p>
<p>Second, the description is also viewed from the narrator, who gives a physical explanation with the authority of a Greek natural philosopher.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150045"><sup>45</sup></xref> Even though the explanation is obscured by technical jargon, the historian&#x2019;s main concern is allegedly not to give a definite elucidation of an uncertain and dubious matter, but to note that the universe operates in accordance with its own laws, providing the human with signs to interpret it (<italic>suppetunt aliae multae opiniones et uariae, quas dinumerare nunc est superuacuum</italic>). In other words, both the excursus on eclipses and on the rainbow suggest that Julian&#x2019;s elevation is the outcome, or even the reflection and content, of a cosmic change. Indeed, Ammianus claims, poets rightly consider Iris as messenger of the gods in human affairs (20.11.30), because the Arch, in its intricate physical mechanism, does not fail to communicate a change of circumstances (<italic>ideo apud poetas legimus saepe Irim de caelo tunc mitti, cum praesentium rerum uerti necesse sit status</italic>). All this unmistakably leads the reader to infer that divine authorities have sanctioned Julian&#x2019;s usurpation.</p>
<p>And third, the explanation is also considered from Constantius, whose standpoint is privileged in the last two paragraphs of the chapter (31&#x2013;32), that close book 20 as well. So, without breaking abruptly from the narrative line, Ammianus further develops the idea of how emperors react to cosmic warnings. Constantius is torn between hope and fear, what has been caused not so much by the events themselves, but by seeing the celestial signs (<italic>His ac talibus imperator inter spem metumque iactabatur</italic>). Thus, rainbows and inclement weather confirm that the <italic>machina mundi</italic><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150046"><sup>46</sup></xref> is functioning as usual.</p>
<p>The comparison with other passages that exemplify the Emperor&#x2019;s response to signs of his fate, especially with 21.14.1, reveals that cosmic warnings are part of a broader narrative plan to characterise Constantius&#x2019; emperorship and ability to make decisions.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150047"><sup>47</sup></xref> In that section the Emperor appears again anguished by omens, while soothsayers give him only responses that are to his liking:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>In hoc rerum aduersarum tumultu haerens eius fortuna iam et subsistens aduentare casum uitae difficilem modo non loquentibus signis | aperte monstrabat. namque et nocturnis imaginibus terrebatur et nondum penitus mersus in somnum umbram uiderat patris obtulisse pulchrum infantem eumque susceptum et locatum in gremio suo | excussam sibi proiecisse longius sphaeram, quam ipse dextra manu gestabat. id autem permutationem temporum indicabat, licet interpretantes placentia responderunt.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150048"><sup>48</sup></xref></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Constantius&#x2019; reaction is dominated by fear, in the same way as he had been frightened in 20.11.31&#x2013;32, after the military failure at Bezabde and the vision of rainbows. Similar narrative patterns with other nuances can be observed as well in chapter 25.10, devoted to Jovian&#x2019;s last days, which is analysed in the following section.</p>

<title>Controversial Comets: Amm. 25.10.2&#x2013;3.</title>
<p>From a structural point of view, book 25 is concluded by a chapter (25.10) arranged as an episodic chain of subsequent events: arrival in Antioch of the <italic>comitatus</italic>, omens of Jovian&#x2019;s death, rush for marching on, final provisions on Julian&#x2019;s corpse, report of the situation in Gaul, opening of the Consulate in Ancyra, Emperor&#x2019;s death at Dadastana, and obituary. The two opening paragraphs set a tone that dominates over the rest of the chapter: when the expedition arrives in Antioch, several omens occurred (<italic>multa uisebantur et dira</italic>), which the experts (<italic>gnari prodigialium [rerum]</italic>) interpreted as calamitous as though the divine numen had been offended.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150049"><sup>49</sup></xref></p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Among the <italic>multa dira</italic> (1) three signs are specifically pointed out. Two of them took place at the governor&#x2019;s palace: the statue of Emperor Maximian loses the globe from his hand,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150051"><sup>51</sup></xref> and the beams of the consistory horribly squeak. In contrast, the third sign is a celestial phenomenon, the vision of comets in broad daylight (2: &#x2026; <italic>et sunt interdiu sidera cometarum uisa</italic>). The first two go unnoticed, but the third is developed at some length in a brief excursus,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150052"><sup>52</sup></xref> in which the historian emphasises that the experts&#x2019; opinion about comets is controversial (<italic>super quorum natura ratiocinantes physici uariant</italic>), and that a full exposition of everything written on the matter would exceed the purpose of his narration (3: <italic>plura alia de cometis apud peritos mundanae rationis sunt lecta, quae digerere nunc uetat aliorsum oratio properans</italic>), in terms notably similar to the final remarks on the rainbow (20.11.30: <italic>aliae multae opinions et uariae, quas dinumerare nunc est superuacuum</italic> &#x2026;).</p>
<p>As in the two cases above, the narrator provides his narratee with three different viewpoints upon the omens. First, the perspective of divination specialists (<italic>gnari rerum prodigialium</italic>),<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150053"><sup>53</sup></xref> who tied together three very different orders of signs, and who are only partially right. Actually, the explanation on comets placed at the end states that comets are just one type of star, but human minds ignore when these are born and die (<italic>certe stellas esse quasdam ceteris similes &#x2026; humanis mentibus ignorari</italic>). So Ammianus is probably recalling the <italic>pauidae mentes</italic> of the two other digressions.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150054"><sup>54</sup></xref></p>
<p>Second, the eye of the narrator, whose persona is invested with the authority of erudition and first-hand information, for Ammianus subtly claims to have been a direct witness of the events,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150055"><sup>55</sup></xref> after his retreat from Ctesiphon (<italic>Antiochiam uenimus</italic>),<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150056"><sup>56</sup></xref> so that he had allegedly been present not only to those signs, but also to the experts&#x2019; interpretation and Jovian&#x2019;s reaction.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150057"><sup>57</sup></xref></p>
<p>And finally, the worries of Jovian, who hurried from Antioch towards Constantinople. Ironically, the title added by Adrien de Valois<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150058"><sup>58</sup></xref> for this chapter explained the Emperor&#x2019;s rush on the basis of his dread of an uprising (<italic>Iouianus metu rerum nouarum per Syriam, Cappadociam et Galatiam celeriter itinere facto Ancyrae cum Varroniano filio infante consulatum init</italic> &#x2026;), but in fact, nothing in this chapter explicitly or implicitly suggests so. The fear of a revolt is actually mentioned and treated in chapter 9, while in chapter 10 the narrator&#x2019;s emphasis is posed rather on the emperor&#x2019;s incapability of understanding the portents;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150059"><sup>59</sup></xref> these affected his concerns, so that he tried to escape them (<italic>moratum paulisper Antiochiae principem curarumque ponderibus diuersis afflictum exeundi mira cupiditas agitabat</italic>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150060"><sup>60</sup></xref> Furthermore, the fate stimulated Jovian to hasten from Ancyra and to arrive in Dadastana (<italic>Hinc quoque Iouianum &#x2026; praescriptus uitae finiendae dies exegit</italic>). In other words, his hurry did nothing more than bringing him closer and closer to the place and date set for his death.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150061"><sup>61</sup></xref> Summing up, Jovian was unable to grasp that his destiny was written in advance, that interpreting comets was too controversial for him, and ultimately that fleeing from one&#x2019;s doom is hopeless.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150062"><sup>62</sup></xref></p>
<p>In a treatment similar to the other two passages already analysed, the narrator explains an astronomical phenomenon in the context of signs that foresight an emperor&#x2019;s end and are mistakenly interpreted by this.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150063"><sup>63</sup></xref> In this case, however, the digression concludes book 25 and ultimately the Julianic narrative and gives a particular emphasis to this feature of Jovian. This epitomises the greatest failure of emperorship, from his dubious accession<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150064"><sup>64</sup></xref> to the shameful truce with Persia, and finally to his illiterate ineptitude for properly reacting to cosmic warnings.</p>

<title>Warnings and Responses</title>
<p>The emphasis on the tripartite point of view that is common to the three aforementioned sections, as well as other textual coincidences and narrative similarities, reveal a particular purpose within the narrative design, beyond the author&#x2019;s fondness of divination&#x2019;s matters that pervades his narration. Remarkably, all three digressions show a recurrent pattern of &#x201C;cosmic warnings,&#x201D; &#x201C;popular reaction,&#x201D; &#x201C;scientific explanation,&#x201D; and &#x201C;imperial response.&#x201D; The structural and argumentative correspondences bring to light that the historian has purposely highlighted the variety of cosmic warnings that secondary <italic>Augusti</italic> received, how they reacted, as well as what awareness they had of their own looming end and, therefore, of their entry into posterity. Regarding the scientific explanation, the three digressions are better integrated into the narrative flow than most digressive sections, since they are explaining remarks to phenomena interpreted as omens by some actor in the narrative. In 20.3.1&#x2013;12, there is no opening formula; popular terror of cosmic phenomena is followed by a verbose, and otherwise confusing, exposition of eclipses, without mediating the usual excuse. Similarly, the brief explanation on rainbows in 20.11 completes the thunder and lightning that terrified the troops and is continued by the impression caused in Constantius&#x2019; mind. For their part, the two paragraphs on the origin of comets (25.10.2&#x2013;3) that highlight the matter&#x2019;s difficulty immediately pursue the portents seen by Jovian and his <italic>comitatus</italic> in Antioch.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that these three digressions bestow the narrator&#x2019;s persona with the authority of the Greek and Latin scholar in interpreting the signs given by the cosmos.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150065"><sup>65</sup></xref> His superiority is emphatically opposed to the fearful ignorant of physical causes, and suggests intimacy and complicity between narrator and narratee, as if Ammianus were detaching himself and his audience from timorous common people.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150066"><sup>66</sup></xref> Significantly, the historian does not explicitly relate these three digressions to the prognosis of the future or the divine sanction of past, taking for granted both the prophetic power the <italic>occurrentia signa</italic> and the reader&#x2019;s familiarity with this traditional standpoint.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150067"><sup>67</sup></xref> As mentioned, eclipses were usually associated with a reversal of fortune, but the historian spares any mention to this, detailing the physical aspects of the phenomenon. Likewise, the account of rainbows is merely descriptive and gives information only about optical mechanisms, paying no attention to why the celestial arch might become a presage of the moment. Finally, the explanation about comets stresses the lack of consensus on their origin among scientists, without elucidating why daylight comets foretell Jovian&#x2019;s end, as was commonly understood. In the two first cases, it is relevant that the cosmic warnings affected the fearful minds and Constantius&#x2019; mind, who was &#x201C;torn between hope and fear.&#x201D; In the third case, the succinct digression on comets focalises Jovian&#x2019;s last days from the point of view of those who were in Antioch and accompanied the emperor in his desperate flight.</p>
<p>Thus, Constantius&#x2019;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150068"><sup>68</sup></xref> and Jovian&#x2019;s responses to the signs, elucidated through astronomical digressions, disapprovingly complete their portrayal as <italic>Augusti</italic>, since both emperors failed to interpret the warnings and to properly react upon them. Furthermore, their figures are to be contrasted with Julian&#x2019;s attitude to omens during the Persian disaster, particularly with his ambiguous response to the vision of the <italic>genius publicus</italic> in 25.2.4, when &#x201C;he commended his future fate to the decrees of heaven&#x201D; (<italic>uentura decretis caelestibus commendabat</italic>), shortly before disdaining the Etruscan discipline (<italic>id inter alia multa spernente</italic>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150069"><sup>69</sup></xref> The chapter also contains a warning sent to Julian by the heaven in the form of a shooting star, the various explanations of which are commented in a two-paragraph digression introduced by <italic>sufficiet pauca monstrare</italic>. In this case, the pattern &#x201C;cosmic warning&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;popular reaction&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;scientific explanation&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;imperial response&#x201D; has been subjected to some minor alterations. The people&#x2019;s <italic>pauidae mentes</italic> seem to have been substituted by the <italic>profanus et demens</italic> who believe that celestial bodies can fall from heaven, but also from Julian&#x2019;s first fearful reaction (<italic>ad momentum haesit stupore defixus</italic>) followed by his surrender to the heavenly decrees (<italic>omni tamen superior metu uentura decretis caelestibus commendabat</italic>).</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>25.2.4-8: et quamquam ad momentum haesit stupore defixus, omni tamen superior metu uentura decretis caelestibus commendabat relictoque humi strato cubili adulta iam excitus nocte et numinibus per sacra depulsoria supplicans flagrantissimam facem cadenti similem uisam aeris parte sulcata euanuisse existimauit horroreque perfusus est, ne ita aperte minax Martis apparuerit sidus. (5) Erat autem nitor igneus iste, quem diaissonta nos appellamus, nec cadens umquam nec terram contingens. corpora enim qui credit caelitus posse labi, profanus merito iudicatur et demens. fit autem hic habitus modis compluribus, e quibus sufficiet pauca monstrare. (6) scintillas quidam putant ab aetherio candentes uigore parumque porrectius tendere sufficientes exstingui uel certe radiorum flammas iniectas nubibus densis acri scintillare contactu aut, cum lumen aliquod cohaeserit nubi. id enim in stellae speciem figuratum decurrit quidem, dum uiribus ignium sustentatur; amplitudine uero spatiorum exinanitum in aerium soluitur corpus ad substantiam migrans, cuius attritu incaluit nimio. (7) Confestim itaque ante lucis primitias Etrusci haruspices accersiti | consultique, quid astri species portenderet noua, uitandum esse cautissime responderunt, ne quid tunc temptaretur, ex Tarquitianis libris in titulo de rebus diuinis id relatum esse monstrantes, quod face in caelo uisa committi proelium uel simile quidquam non oportebit. (8) quo etiam id inter alia multa spernente orabant haruspices saltim aliquot horis profectionem differri et ne hoc quidem sunt adepti imperatore omni uaticinandi scientia reluctante, sed exorto iam die promota sunt castra.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150070"><sup>70</sup></xref></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>More interestingly, however, Julian&#x2019;s response differs from Constantius&#x2019; and Jovian&#x2019;s, not in a better comprehension of natural phenomena or in a more philosophical or Stoic abandon to fate, but in a better promptness of decision. In fact, Julian is torn between acceptance (25.2.4: <italic>omni tamen superior metu uentura decretis caelestibus commendabat</italic>) and rejection of the divinatory technique (8: <italic>omni uaticinandi scientia reluctante</italic>) during the Persian campaign until his final moment.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150071"><sup>71</sup></xref> Therefore, Ammianus focuses on describing the emperor&#x2019;s inner conflict that will be appeased only at his deathbed, so that Julian contrasts with the other two <italic>Augusti</italic> in that he overcomes his doubts, is not affected by the terrors of the ordinary people, and ultimately accepts the cosmic warnings so that he can face up to a properly Augustan departure from life.</p>

<title>Narrator and Emperorship</title>
<p>In summary, Julian&#x2019;s reaction to the last celestial signs about his impending end has been carefully anticipated and continued through a recurring pattern in the narrative. By this means, the historian draws the reader&#x2019;s attention on the continuities and dissimilarities that Julian&#x2019;s demise has with that of Constantius and Jovian. In every case of the four discussed, each cosmic warning is misinterpreted by some character, is correctly explained by the narrator based on scientific knowledge, and is differently reacted upon by the emperor.</p>
<p>In addition to characterising the three emperors&#x2019; approach to fate, these excursuses are particularly integrated into the narrative, as their brevity and loose use of introductory and reverting phrases show. Furthermore, they highlight intratextual connections between different sections and a gradation in how digressions are integrated in the narrative flow. So, the findings of my analysis, necessarily limited, show that at least some of Ammianus&#x2019; excursuses have a more valuable literary meaning than credited so far. In the case of the cosmic-astronomical digressions, neither the narrative is adapted to fit the digressions nor are these attuned to the facts: both parts are modelled by Ammianus adding nuances to his imperial portrayals. Down this line, a narratological approach to the excursuses in the <italic>Res Gestae</italic> allows us to surpass the limitations of a too rigid concept of the historian&#x2019;s digressions that puts in the same plane digressive sections, digressive comments or digressive tone, which are phenomena certainly related, but that Ammianus exploits with diverse purposes according to the occasion. On the other hand, some particular aspects of the study, such as the relation of the eclipse and rainbow digressions to other passages of Constantius&#x2019; narrative, particularly with 21.14 on his final omens,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150072"><sup>72</sup></xref> the singular imbrication of the eclipses excursus with the rest of the book 21, or the motivations of Jovian in 25.10 certainly require further investigation.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150073"><sup>73</sup></xref> However, this on-going research demonstrates the effectiveness of the narratological approach, and opens up possibilities for similar inquiries in other passages referring to Gallus, Valentinian, Valens, and Gratian.</p>
<p>Finally, the consideration of minor passages of minor stars has further illuminated that Julian&#x2019;s centrality in Ammianus&#x2019; narrative is revealed in contrast to the other imperial characters, and that Constantius&#x2019; and Jovian&#x2019;s depictions need to be properly understood only in comparison with Julian. Conversely, Julian&#x2019;s narrative only makes full sense in the interaction with other prior and posterior emperors. This point reminds us that Ammianus&#x2019; <italic>Res Gestae</italic> is not primarily a work about Julian, but, rather, a narrative of emperorship based on the assumption that to be Emperor of Rome does not rely on the relative adherence to the perfect ruler&#x2019;s paradigm or on the capricious twists of fortune;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN150074"><sup>74</sup></xref> it rather consists in being inserted in a long series of rulers which could trace its roots back several centuries, and would be perpetuated for times to come.</p>

<p>In a similar vein, the final sections of some books are prone to include ominous material (19.12.19; 20.11.32; 25.10.17; 26.10.17&#x2013;19; it can be questioned also whether the insects darkening the skies in 24.8.4 might be considered as a cosmic warning). This tendency can be tracked down to the Roman annalistic tradition.</p>

<p>In addition, the historian gives prominence to accusations of magical practices in connection with treason trials: e.g. 18.3.1&#x2013;7; 19.12.14&#x2013;15; 26.3.1&#x2013;4; 28.1.6&#x2013;42; 29.1.6; 29.2.17; 29.2.28; 30.5.11.</p>

<p>&#x201C;For his part, he sharpened and inflamed his desire to first attack Constantius, now that Gaul was quieted, since he inferred from many prophetic signs (in which he was an expert) and from dreams that Constantius would shortly depart from life.&#x201D; English translations of Ammianus are taken from Rolfe 1940, with several changes.</p>

<label>16</label>
<p>The narrator (allegedly based on the authority provided by being direct witness, stressed that the interpretations of the philosophers, Greek scientists, and those of the Etruscan haruspices on the omens that precede the disastrous end were conflicting) does not clearly indicate whether Julian prefers to ignore the wrong interpretation of philosophers, whether he ceased believing in prophecies (25.2.8), or if he gave up to the ineluctable fate.</p>

<fn id="FN150017">
<label>17</label>
<p>&#x201C;And since malicious people attribute to an emperor both learned and devoted to all knowledge evil arts for divining future events, it has to be briefly explained why this not trivial kind of learning also may be added to a learned man&#x2019;s equipment (7).&#x201D;</p>
</fn>
<fn id="FN150018">
<label>18</label>
<p>As Ross 2016, 180&#x2013;89 explains, the purpose of such narrative is to provide a Roman explanation of Julian&#x2019;s failure in Persia in the context of the Greek versions of the Emperor&#x2019;s death. This point resumes the discussion present in sources immediately posterior to Julian&#x2019;s death.</p>

<p>&#x201C;And I shall not be ashamed to admit, that I learned long ago from a trustworthy prophecy that I should perish by the sword. And therefore, I thank the eternal power that meet my end, not from secret conspiracies, nor from the prolonged pain of an illness, nor by the fate of a criminal, but that in the mid-career of glorious renown I have been found worthy of so noble a departure from this world. For, justly considered, he is as equally weak and cowardly who desires to die when he ought not, or he who seeks to avoid death when his time has come.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;At that same time, throughout the regions of the East (<italic>per eoos tractus</italic>) the heaven was seen to be overcast with dark mist, through which the stars were visible continually from the first break of day until noon. It was an additional cause of terror when the light of heaven was hidden and its orb removed utterly from the sight of the world, that the timorous minds of men thought that the darkening of the sun lasted too long; but it thinned out at first into the form of the crescent moon, then growing to the shape of the half-moon, and was finally fully restored.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;This phenomenon never takes place so clearly as when the moon, after its shifting courses, brings back its monthly journey to the same starting-point after fixed intervals of time; that is to say, when the entire moon, in the abode of the same sign of the zodiac, is found in a perfectly straight line directly under the sun, and for a brief time stands still in the minute points which the science of geometry calls parts of parts.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;After these words had been reported and much had been added with a malicious interpretation, Constantius was angered beyond measure; and without examining the matter or allowing the details of which he was ignorant to be explained, he ordered the victim of the calumnies to give up his command in the army and go into retirement, promoting Agilo, a former tribune of the gentiles and the scutarii, to his place, by an extraordinary advancement.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;When Constantius was hastening to lend aid to the Orient, which was likely soon to be disturbed by the inroads of Persians, as deserters reported in agreement with our scouts, he was tormented by jealousy of the valorous deeds of Julian &#x2026; (2) Excited by these and similar exploits, and fearing that their fame would grow greater, urged on besides, as was reported, by the prefect Florentius, he sent Decentius, the tribune and secretary, at once to take from Julian his auxiliaries, namely, the Aeruli and Batavi and the Celts with the Petulantes, as well as three hundred picked men from each of the other divisions of the army; and he ordered him to hasten their march under the pretext that they might be able to be on hand for an attack on the Parthians early in the spring.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;But the result was different from what he guessed. (25) For when the fighting slackened, wet weather followed, dripping clouds with menacing darkness appeared, and the ground was so drenched with continual rains, that soft and sticky mud caused general trouble in that region of rich turf. And, besides all this, thunder and lightning with repeated crashes terrified the timorous minds of men. (26) More than this, rainbows were constantly seen; and how that phenomenon is wont to occur, a brief explanation will show &#x2026; (30) &#x2026; There are many other different opinions, which it would be superfluous to enumerate at present, since my narrative is in haste to return to the point from which it digressed. (31) For these and similar reasons the emperor was torn between hope and fear, since the severity of winter was drawing near and attacks were to be looked for in that trackless region, while also he feared mutiny of the exasperated soldiers. Besides this, his anxious mind was tormented by the thought that when, so to speak, the door of a rich house was open before him, he was returning without success.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;After this business had been thus attended to, we came by long marches to Antioch; where for successive days, as though the divinity were angered, many fearful portents were seen, which those skilled in such signs declared would have sad results. (2) For the statue of the Caesar Maximianus, which stood in the vestibule of the royal palace, suddenly dropped the bronze ball, in the form of the globe of heaven, which it was holding, the beams of the council hall gave forth an awful creaking, and in broad daylight comets were seen, about which the views of those versed in natural history are at variance. (3) For some think that they are so called because they are numerous stars united in one body, and send out writhing fires resembling hair &#x2026; or at any rate, that comets are stars like the rest, the appointed times of whose rising and setting are not understood by human minds. Many other theories about comets are to be found in the writings of those who are skilled in knowledge of the universe; but from discussing these I am prevented by my haste to continue my narrative. (4) The emperor lingered for a time at Antioch, bowed down by the diverse weight of his anxieties, but pursued by an extraordinary desire for getting out of the place. Accordingly, he left there on a day in the dead of winter, sparing neither horse nor man, although many signs (as has been said) forbade, and entered Tarsus, the famous city of Cilicia, of whose origin I have already spoken &#x2026;.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;And although for a moment he remained sunk in stupefaction, yet rising above all fear, he commended his future fate to the decrees of heaven, and now fully awake, the night being now far advanced, he left his bed, which was spread on the ground, and prayed to the gods with rites designed to avert their displeasure. Then he thought he saw a blazing torch of fire, like a falling star, which furrowed part of the air and disappeared. And he was filled with fear lest the threatening star of Mars had thus visibly shown itself. (5) That fiery brilliance was of the kind that we call &#x03B4;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;&#x0390;&#x03C3;&#x03C3;&#x03C9;&#x03BD;, which never falls anywhere or touches the earth; for anyone who believes that bodies can fall from heaven is rightly considered a layman, or a fool. But this phenomenon happens in many ways, and it will be enough to explain a few of them. (6) Some believe that sparks glowing from the ethereal force, (&#x2026;) (7) Accordingly, before dawn the Etruscan soothsayers were hastily summoned, and asked what this unusual kind of star portended. Their reply was, that any undertaking at that time must be most carefully avoided, pointing out that in the Tarquitian books, under the rubric &#x201C;On signs from heaven&#x201D; it was written, that when a meteor was seen in the sky, battle ought not to be joined, or anything similar attempted. 8 When the emperor scorned this also, as well as many other signs, the soothsayers begged that at least he would put off his departure for some hours; but even this they could not gain, since the emperor was opposed to the whole science of divination, but since day had now dawned, camp was broken.&#x201D;</p>

<title>Introduction<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN170000"><sup>*</sup></xref></title>
<p>When looking at the images of the Roman emperors of Late Antiquity, the first and most striking impression is that of enduring stability; the physical appearance of late antique rulers remained the same for quite a long period of time, even for decades. The simple fact that an emperor&#x2019;s face normally undergoes some changes with the passing of time, or that emperors die and new ones take their place, seems not to have influenced very much the way the rulers&#x2019; images were conveyed through visual media. For example, on Constantine&#x2019;s coinage, the emperor&#x2019;s face does not change substantially between his second portrait type (created in <sc>AD</sc> 310, when he was about 37 years old)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN170001"><sup>1</sup></xref> and his fourth (created <italic>ca.</italic> <sc>AD</sc> 330, when he was 57).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN170002"><sup>2</sup></xref> The later version has slightly longer hair, and the traditional laurel crown has been replaced by the diadem, but, besides a somewhat fleshier quality of the face, no clear signs of ageing are detectable; at 60, the emperor does not look much different from when he was 35 years old.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN170003"><sup>3</sup></xref> Constantine&#x2019;s sons and successors were apparently not very interested in conveying their own individual appearances; their coin portraits are virtually indistinguishable from one another, as well as from those of their father. Therefore, without the guidance provided by numismatic iconography, many sculptural portraits have been attributed by archaeologists and museum curators, with varying degrees of uncertainty, to Constantine himself or one or more of his sons.</p>
<p>This self-representational choice reflects a typical late antique tendency. Admittedly, the first Roman emperor, Augustus, had chosen to represent himself in a similar way; his second portrait type (the so-called &#x2018;Prima Porta type&#x2019;), created when he was 35 years old, continued to be widely used until his death at 75, and even later for posthumous depictions.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN170004"><sup>4</sup></xref> Generally, however, during the first three centuries of the Roman Empire, the public image of the emperor had changed rapidly and significantly. Every new emperor, at the moment of his accession, had chosen his own portrait, which was in most cases quite different from that of his predecessor. The reasons for such a continuous shift of images were twofold, being at the same time both political and stylistic. From a political point of view, imperial self-representation was conveyed in this period through an individualised portrait. This was possible because the emperor was first and foremost a Roman citizen, who happened to have been chosen to perform a very important public function; artistic representation privileged the individual over the function, indulging in the depiction of the emperors&#x2019; particular facial features. But, on the other hand, such a variety in imperial portraiture would have not been possible without the considerable abundance of means of expression &#x2013; that is, of styles &#x2013; made available by the characteristic eclecticism of Roman art. Every emperor, and every artist, could choose, among a multiplicity of stylistic options, those which they thought would convey the desired messages in a more effective way.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S170002" sec-type="heading-1">
<label>6.2</label>
<title>Eclecticism and the Palette of Stylistic Options</title>
<p>While the political reasons for fostering the desire for an individualised imperial portrait have long been recognised by Roman art historians, especially Paul Zanker and Bert Smith,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN170005"><sup>5</sup></xref> the stylistic aspect is still in my opinion underestimated. This can be interpreted as the consequence of a long-lasting prejudice against Roman art, usually considered as little more than a not particularly original re-elaboration of Greek models. Only recently a more positive evaluation of Roman eclecticism started developing, especially regarding the genre of ideal sculpture, calling for a better appreciation of the creativity of Roman artists in the choice and re-elaboration of their models.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN170006"><sup>6</sup></xref> The availability of a wide range of models coming from different traditions resulted in the possibility to express any desired content by means of at least three different stylistic languages. First, what has been traditionally called the &#x2018;Republican realism,&#x2019; which was, in fact, rather a kind of expressionism, the depiction of the human face through the exacerbation of individual characters and signs of ageing, in order to achieve a more immediate and powerful expression of meaning. Second, the late Hellenistic international style, characterised by a highly theatrical depiction of feelings and passions, so as to enhance the dramatic effect of the artwork on the viewer. Third, formal Classicism, offering a limpid and idealised representation of the subject through stylistic features which looked back to the Greek (in most cases, Athenian) masterpieces of the fifth and fourth centuries <sc>BC</sc>. These three stylistic options were already fully developed by the end of the second century <sc>BC</sc>. These tendencies, and the many possible interactions between them, shaped the development of all the different genres of Roman art until the end of antiquity.</p>
<p>In the following pages, I will examine the continually shifting balance of these stylistic trends within the genre of imperial portraiture during the fourth century <sc>AD</sc>, articulating its varying developments down to the Theodosian period. I will focus especially on sculptural portraits, which were set up in the public spaces of late antique cities, conveying an image of the ruler produced by initiative of the local elites, but based on an official image issued directly by the imperial court. Such a study in the evolution of imperial portraiture will offer new insights for interpreting the image of the ruler in a key transitional moment, when emperors had to reinvent their role within the new framework of the late antique Christian Empire following a period of great political and cultural transformations.</p>
<p>A good starting point for our analysis can be set around the end of the third century, when a fundamental change in the stylistic awareness of Roman artists and viewers seems to have taken place. In this period, a general shift towards abstraction can be observed. The portrait, as well as the human face which lies behind it, are no longer understood as a unity, which the artist may interpret through one of the three styles I mentioned, but rather as the accumulation of single, independent elements, each of which may be realised according to different models, traditions, and stylistic options. As a consequence, each facial feature of a portrait is abstracted from the surrounding context and transformed into a formulaic element, which can be exploited as an autonomous carrier of meaning. The viewer will then reconstruct the overall message by adding the individual pieces of meaning attached to each detail and integrating them into a global picture, not necessarily free from inconsistencies.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN170007"><sup>7</sup></xref> This new concept is excellently embodied by the porphyry portraits of the tetrarchic period (fig. 6.1), in which every element of the emperor&#x2019;s face takes on an autonomous role as the formulaic expression of an imperial quality: the short hair and beard, typical features of military iconography, express the emperor&#x2019;s ostentatious renouncing of an aristocratic self-representation; the deep wrinkles on the forehead show the constant concern of the ruler for the well-being of the Empire; the enormous, expressionist eyes are meant to see everything happening everywhere in the world, as well as in the mind and soul of every single citizen.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN170008"><sup>8</sup></xref> Again, this aesthetic development is not unrelated to the new political scenario. The tetrarchic ideology was not particularly interested in representing the emperors as individuals. In the famous group portraits, such as the one now outside St Mark&#x2019;s Basilica in Venice (fig. 6.2), the four rulers are virtually indistinguishable from one another, in the general shape of their heads and faces as well as in their physiognomic features; even the short beards differentiating between senior and junior emperors have been recognised as later additions. To develop on a very effective formulation by Bert Smith, Roman imperial portraiture in this period shifted from the depiction of a &#x201C;particular person, whom the viewer knew &#x2026; also happened to be emperor,&#x201D;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN170009"><sup>9</sup></xref> to a generic portrait of &#x2018;the&#x2019; emperor; all the portrayed emperors could be identified with a name, but they were depicted first and foremost as rulers, not as individuals. In other words, the main interest in the emperor&#x2019;s portrait is no longer his individuality, but rather his function, i.e. the possession of those virtues and qualities which made him worthy of that function. Thus, tetrarchic imperial portraits (and late antique portraits in general) can be understood as the result of a powerful combination of public statements and aesthetic choices. The emperor&#x2019;s new depiction as a political figure, rather than an individual, is backed through a conscious stylistic change, privileging the abstraction of single elements as carriers of meaning over the rendering of the portrait as a coherent unity.</p>

<p>After the tetrarchic experience, the Constantinian imperial face, invented in <sc>AD</sc> 310 with Constantine&#x2019;s second portrait type (fig. 6.3), conveyed an entirely different set of values. It did so by exploiting a similar combination of elements, but using a very different stylistic language; the tetrarchic expressionism was replaced by strongly classicising aesthetics. The harmonious proportions, the carefully combed hair, the absence of any sign of ageing, and the overall calm and serenity are expressions of a new imperial ideal, which is as independent from the ruler&#x2019;s individual features as the strong and incisive tetrarchic portraits were. The imperial image now marks the unbridgeable distance separating the emperor from every other human being, mirroring at the same time the peace and serenity which the whole world enjoys thanks to its ruler. The well-being of the Empire and its citizens is no longer presented, as was the case in the tetrarchic period, as the hard-won result of the emperor&#x2019;s continuous effort, but rather as a permanent state, granted to the world by divine blessing, thanks to the physical and moral perfection of its ruler. Significantly, this development seems not strictly related to the emperor&#x2019;s personal religious beliefs; the essential elements of this new kind of self-representation were left untouched by Julian&#x2019;s revival of the traditional religion. The last pagan emperor contented himself with adding a beard to the (by that time) well-established Constantinian portrait, leaving all the other elements of the classicising imperial face &#x2013; and their ideological significance &#x2013; virtually unchanged.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN170010"><sup>10</sup></xref></p>

<p>When, in <sc>AD</sc> 363, Julian&#x2019;s untimely death brought the dynasty to an abrupt end, his military successors sought new ways of self-representation. The Constantinian portrait, which had shaped the emperor&#x2019;s image for more than fifty years, could not easily be ignored; after all, that was the emperor&#x2019;s face with which every Roman was by now acquainted. But the new rulers, first Jovian (<italic>reg.</italic> 363&#x2013;364) and then the brothers Valentinian (<italic>reg</italic>. 364&#x2013;375) and Valens (<italic>reg.</italic> 364&#x2013;378), wanted to stress a key difference between themselves and their immediate predecessors; they had not been born as princes of the imperial family, but had made their careers in the army, serving the Empire with loyalty and self-sacrifice, as the Tetrarchs had done before them. The new late antique aesthetics, representing the human face as the sum of single autonomous elements, served their purpose very well. Some classicising features of the Constantinian imperial face could be combined with other, more expressionist ones, taken from the tetrarchic portrait, thus producing a hybrid image conveying the positive values of both traditions.</p>
<p>No sculptural portrait of the short-lived Jovian is known, but his coins already show a marked difference with respect to the Constantinian tradition; now the emperor starts staging himself as corpulent and fat-faced. Even in a highly idealised portrait, as is typical for gold coinage, the large neck and fleshy double chin are clearly recognisable (fig. 6.4); especially noteworthy is the fading line of the jaw, almost disappearing in a continuous fleshy surface connecting the chin to the neck. This emphasis on corpulence is by no means new. An intermittent series of fat-faced rulers can be followed as an underground trend in fourth-century imperial portraiture, beginning rather subtly with Maximian, and finding its best expression with Licinius (<italic>reg.</italic> 308&#x2013;324), Constantine&#x2019;s brother-in-law and last surviving rival. As Bert Smith has shown in a groundbreaking article,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN170011"><sup>11</sup></xref> Licinius developed his public image in explicit opposition to that of Constantine. In sharp contrast to the latter&#x2019;s sublimated image as the emperor chosen by God, Licinius picked such iconographic elements as the corpulence and the smile in order to stylise himself as a vigorous, down-to-earth, accessible ruler.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN170012"><sup>12</sup></xref> The same message was then appropriated by the military usurpers of the mid-fourth century, such as Magnentius and Decentius (350&#x2013;353), who also sought to appear as resolute but friendly leaders (fig. 6.5), in contrast to the beautiful, distant emperors of the Constantinian dynasty.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN170013"><sup>13</sup></xref> We can assume that Jovian and the Valentinians, by inserting this element into their own portraits, wanted to convey a similar message; vigour and strength on the one side, accessibility and openness on the other. The resulting image was a patchwork of elements pertaining to different iconographic traditions, each with a precise political significance: the hairstyle and diadem assured the continuity with the Constantinian dynasty; the large, deep eyes and the frown lines on the forehead, borrowed directly from tetrarchic portraiture, visualised the ruler&#x2019;s concern for his people and his ability of seeing what was better for the Empire; while the fat and fleshy face, similarly derived from late tetrarchic models, affirmed the concreteness of emperors who were no longer haughty and inaccessible, but down-to-earth soldiers, who had experienced the difficulties of human life and whose bodies and minds had been strengthened by the hardness of military service.</p>

<p>Although scholars have proposed several tentative groupings, it has proved impossible to classify these works into different sculptural types, as normally done with earlier imperial portraits. As Bert Smith pointed out, the shift from individual representation to a rather standardised imperial image brought about, as a consequence, the loss of importance of the traditional system of copy and replication, which constitutes the basis for the study of earlier portraiture. In Late Antiquity no exact copies were probably needed, since the ruler&#x2019;s recognisability was no longer achieved through his likeness, but through the presence of specifically imperial attributes, first of all the diadem.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN170020"><sup>20</sup></xref> A characteristic phenomenon, already mentioned concerning Constantine&#x2019;s sons, also occurs in the case of Valentinian and Valens; it is virtually impossible to precisely identify each portrait as depicting one of the two brothers. On their coins they are completely indistinguishable from one another, and we can assume that this was also the case with their statues. This exaggerated resemblance was a significant political statement in itself, with important precedents in the history of Roman imperial portraiture; like their tetrarchic predecessors, the two ruling brothers embodied one and the same function, ostentatiously sharing one will and a total unity of intent. The same phenomenon can be observed in the portrait in Tivoli, which does not show any signs of age; the youthful face suggests that the person depicted is one of Valentinian&#x2019;s sons (either Gratian or Valentinian <sc>II</sc>), without any possibility of distinguishing between the two.</p>

<p>Concerning their iconographic features, the portraits of the Valentinianic emperors are an exemplary illustration of the ability of late antique artists to juxtapose elements taken from different traditions. The adherence to the Constantinian model is evident, for example, in the straight hair, with fringe on the forehead, as well as the idealised face, with shaven cheeks and only limited signs of age. But, in contrast with the classicising, imperturbable serenity of the Constantinian portraits, Valentinian and Valens show a stronger facial expression, conveyed especially by the extreme contraction of the eyebrows, concentrating all the energy on the bridge of the nose and producing a remarkable swelling at the exterior edge of the orbits. The triangular bulge at the centre of the forehead, as well as the geometrical design of the wrinkles, provide yet another link between these images and those of the third-century military emperors, in particular the last portrait type of Caracalla (fig. 6.11) (the first experiment, 150 years earlier, of the introduction of elements taken from military iconography into the genre of imperial portraiture). The lower part of the face, on the contrary, is characterised by a fleshy oval shape with almost inflated cheeks, showing no trace of movement or contraction. The exceptionally well-preserved bust in Vienne presents a short beard around the mouth and under the chin, which is another element referring to military self-representation. We cannot exclude that in the other portraits this short beard was simply painted. From the stylistic point of view, the most striking characteristic of these sculptures is the absence of any plastic interaction between the individual facial features; each of them is positioned as an independent element on the plain surface of the face, with no immediate relation to the surrounding ones. The whole structure of the head is governed by abstract geometrical principles, which turn the emperor&#x2019;s face into a sort of two-dimensional mask.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN170021"><sup>21</sup></xref></p>

<p>The geographic distribution of the documented Valentinianic portraits is also interesting; with the exception of the bust from Vienne, all other surviving sculptural portraits come from Rome. This predominance of the capital, however, does not match the data provided by statue bases; the inscribed record attests that the greatest number of known statues of Valentinian and Valens were actually set up in numerous cities of the African provinces (26 items listed in the <italic>LSA</italic> database). Even so, the abundance of evidence coming from this area may have less to do with the emperors&#x2019; relationship to these provinces and more with their prosperity in this period, and the high degree of preservation of their cities. However, it is interesting to note that, while for earlier emperors such as Constantius <sc>II</sc> and Julian the African evidence is matched by the equally abundant record from Asia Minor, this seems not to be the case for Valentinian and Valens, for whom only a handful of statue bases are documented from Eastern cities. On the other hand, the fact that of the African dedications only the bases have survived gives an interesting indication about the materials favoured in different geographical areas. In the African provinces, the majority of statues were evidently made of bronze and were melted down in subsequent periods; the number of surviving marble portraits from Rome, on the contrary, points to a larger diffusion of marble statues in the capital, probably due to the fact that the senatorial aristocracy were more readily able to afford this more expensive material than provincial governors or local elites.</p>

<title>The Theodosian Turn</title>
<p>After the peculiar combination of elements pertaining to different traditions (from tetrarchic expressionism to the classicising Constantinian aesthetics) deployed by the Valentinianic portraits, Theodosius (<italic>reg.</italic> 379&#x2013;395) and his co-emperors went decidedly back to the Constantinian model, exploiting in full its idealisation potential. Theodosian imperial images look not only idealised and beautiful, but also completely absent and motionless. The emperors are set above the level of humanity, and, accordingly, their faces take on some distinctive marks that had been hitherto typical of the genre of ideal sculpture. This process can already be detected in coin portraits (fig. 6.12); with respect to the Valentinianic, but also Constantinian, precedents, the proportions of the head appear slenderer, and the relation between neck, jaw, and chin is more clearly articulated. The overall expression looks much more delicate, with more refined facial features. The treatment of the hair is also noteworthy. As opposed to the simple straight hair which characterised the Constantinian and Valentinianic emperors, some Theodosian coin portraits feature a peculiarly classicising hairstyle with graphically rendered locks, organised in alternate rows of curls turning into opposite directions.</p>

<p>But it is in the sculptural portraits that the peculiarities of the Theodosian imperial face can be more directly appreciated. Theodosian portraiture goes even further than previously attempted in the direction of a complete absence of individualisation. This tendency is particularly clear in collective depictions; in the famous <italic>missorium</italic> in Madrid, for example, produced on the occasion of Theodosius&#x2019; <italic>decennalia</italic> celebrated in <sc>AD</sc> 388 (fig. 6.13),<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN170022"><sup>22</sup></xref> all three members of the imperial college (Valentinian <sc>II</sc>, Theodosius, and Arcadius) are represented. They are only distinguishable thanks to their attributes and age groups. Theodosius in the centre is represented as a young man (even if he was already over 40 at the time), the 16-year-old Valentinian <sc>II</sc> is depicted on the left with the <italic>insignia</italic> of the <italic>senior Augustus</italic>, while Arcadius, on the right, shows a large, plump face with childish proportions. No distinctively individual features can be detected in their heads; the artist simply acknowledged the three emperors&#x2019; different age groups (although one could argue that the young Valentinian is purposefully depicted a bit smaller than he should be for his age, in order to give more pre-eminence to Theodosius). The expressionist elements which animated the Valentinianic portraits have now disappeared: the faces are absolutely regular, with harmonious proportions; the forehead has no wrinkles and is reduced to a narrow stripe between the two perfect arches of the fringe and the eyebrows; the almond-shaped eyes are big and staring, but their fixed gaze entails no contraction of the facial muscles. The same tendency can be noted in the imperial depictions on the base of the obelisk erected around <sc>AD</sc> 390 in the circus of Constantinople (fig. 6.14).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN170023"><sup>23</sup></xref> Here, the age differentiation between the members of the imperial college is conveyed simply through their dimensions and the different shapes of their heads, ranging from Theodosius&#x2019; slender, elongated face to the round and childish proportions of the six-year-old Honorius.</p>

<p>The most conspicuous feature of these portraits is the absence not only of any signs of age, but also of that internal movement or tension between the single elements of the face which was an essential characteristic of imperial portraiture in the preceding period. While in the Valentinianic portraits, a contrast could be observed between the classicising traits inherited from the Constantinian dynasty and the vigorous facial features coming from the tradition of military self-representation, in the early Theodosian period the extreme idealisation takes over all the elements of the portrait, giving an impression of overall stylistic harmony. This idealisation is particularly clear in the upper part of the face. The forehead is geometrically rendered in the form of a smooth semi-cylindrical surface; the regular arch of the eyebrows, the continuity between the forehead and the nose, as well as the big, almond-shaped eyes can be linked to the tradition of ideal sculpture and its classical and Hellenistic models. As is usual in ancient idealising portraits, the signs of movement and vitality are concentrated in the lower part of the face, characterised by a fleshier and delicately carved surface. Even more than the Valentinianic ones, the surviving Theodosian imperial portraits include some outstanding pieces, for example those in Berlin and Istanbul. The superb quality of their workmanship, showing the mastery of Hellenistic tradition and the command of considerable technical skills (especially in the polishing of the surfaces), should be enough to counter those opinions which, in the past, interpreted the choice of idealisation and the lack of individual traits as the consequence of a decline in naturalistic standards and technical vocabulary.</p>
<p>As was the case for the Valentinians, it is also impossible to identify precise sculptural types in the Theodosian portraits. This is a consequence of different factors, deriving from changes in the process of sculptural production as well as conscious iconographic choices. As I have already pointed out, since the late Constantinian period, some important changes had taken place in the modes of portrait production, which led to the abandonment of the traditional copy system. In addition, the frequent reworking of already existing heads<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN170034"><sup>34</sup></xref> particularly affected the hairstyles, which archaeologists have established as the most important marker for the traditional definition of sculptural types. But, most of all, the portraits themselves display a conscious and intentional lack of individualisation. None of these early Theodosian sculptural portraits would be recognisable as depicting a specific emperor in the absence of external evidence (antiquarian, archaeological, epigraphic). For example, the colossal head of a child in the Capitoline Museum is identifiable as a portrait of Honorius only on iconographic and antiquarian grounds. Since it lacks the diadem, it can be interpreted as a portrait of Theodosius&#x2019; younger son before his co-optation into the imperial college, which took place in 393 when he was eight years old.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN170035"><sup>35</sup></xref> Conversely, the small diademed head of an even younger child, now in the Detroit Institute of Arts, can be identified as a portrait of his brother Arcadius, who had been bestowed the title of Augustus at the age of six. The childish, round and fleshy face is to be interpreted not as an individual feature, but simply as the marker of a specific age group, just as in Arcadius&#x2019; portrait on the right side of the Madrid <italic>missorium</italic>.</p>
<p>We have more information when portraits are found in modern scientific excavations, especially when the bodies of the statues and/or their inscribed bases are preserved. This is the case for the three early Theodosian portraits found in Aphrodisias. The reworked head now in the Geyre museum, found in the so-called Tetrastoon, the colonnaded square in front of the theatre, belonged to a reused togate statue bearing a dedicatory inscription to Theodosius (fig. 6.20).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN170036"><sup>36</sup></xref> The statue body, originally produced in the early imperial period (probably in the second century <sc>AD</sc>), had actually already been reused twice: around <sc>AD</sc> 361&#x2013;363 it was rededicated to the emperor Julian by the provincial governor of Caria at that time, Antonius Tatianus; only a few years later, the same governor rededicated the same statue to Valens. Significantly, when its identity was changed again 25 years later, in the inscription only the name of the portrayed emperor was modified, while Antonius Tatianus still appeared as the dedicator. This means that the patron who ordered this last rededication was less interested in adding his own name than in preserving the memory of his predecessor. This is, in my opinion, a strong argument for the identification of the last dedicator as Flavius Eutolmius Tatianus, Antonius&#x2019; son, who was <italic>praefectus praetorio per Orientem</italic> under Theodosius, between <sc>AD</sc> 388 and 392.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN170037"><sup>37</sup></xref></p>

<p>During his prefecture, the younger Tatianus also dedicated statues of Valentinian <sc>II</sc>, Theodosius, Arcadius, and Honorius in the western portico of the so-called &#x2018;Place of Palms&#x2019; in Aphrodisias, next to the entrance to the baths.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN170038"><sup>38</sup></xref> Two of these statues, probably those depicting Valentinian <sc>II</sc> and Arcadius, are preserved. Again in this case, the only information which may lead to a tentative identification comes from the excavation records, attesting that the headless torso was found near the base inscribed with a dedication to Valentinian <sc>II</sc>, while the better-preserved statue and the base with the dedication to Arcadius were found considerably farther away (fig. 6.21).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN170039"><sup>39</sup></xref> Such identifications based merely on the find-spots would not necessarily be compelling in themselves, but in my opinion they can be confirmed by the iconography of the two statues. These wear a contemporary ceremonial toga, a senatorial garment which the majority of late antique emperors (who were not of senatorial rank) wore only on rare occasions, and especially when acting as consuls. During the five years of Tatianus&#x2019; praetorian prefecture, Valentinian <sc>II</sc> was consul in <sc>AD</sc> 390 and Arcadius in <sc>AD</sc> 392, but both had already been consuls before these dates. Now, the two statues differ in only one detail; one of them raises the right arm above the head, while the other has both arms relaxed. The raised right arm corresponds to a specific iconographic scheme, especially connected with consular duties; it refers to the act of throwing down the <italic>mappa</italic> to start the circus races. Thus, it is possible that the statue with the raised arm depicted the acting consul, performing his function as a magistrate. The other emperor, on the contrary, wears the consular dress because he has been a consul in the past, but is not acting in that capacity at the moment of the dedication. By identifying the acting consul with Valentinian <sc>II</sc> (based on the find-spots of the two statues and their bases), we can date the dedication to <sc>AD</sc> 390. This conclusion is further strengthened by the fact that Tatianus himself was appointed consul in <sc>AD</sc> 391, and it is quite difficult to believe that he would have failed to mention such an honour in the dedicatory inscription, if this was, indeed, carved at a later date.</p>

<p>Let us now go back to the portrait of Theodosius mentioned earlier. The two Tatiani, father and son, were members of a pagan family. This, in my opinion, can explain not only Antonius&#x2019; dedication of a statue to Julian, but also his son&#x2019;s choice of rededicating to Theodosius the same monument that his father had previously set up for the last pagan emperor. As frequently happens with late antique statuary, one cannot address the phenomenon of reuse without taking into consideration the availability of financial and material resources. As praetorian prefect, second in authority only to the emperors, the younger Tatianus was much more powerful than his father had ever been, and had access to much larger financial means. This explains why he was able to commission four entirely new marble statues for his dedication in the Place of Palms, whereas his father had to be content with reusing a convenient statue body which probably had been lying around for a while. But this is not enough, in my opinion, to obliterate the dedicators&#x2019; agency and the degree of intentionality displayed by their reuses. After all, in a place like Aphrodisias there must have been several old statues which could potentially be reused for a new dedication; choosing among them was an intentional act, connected with the message which the patron envisaged for his new monument. Moreover, the decision by the younger Tatianus to rededicate his father&#x2019;s already twice-reused monument, instead of just commissioning one more new statue (like the ones he set up in the Place of Palms), must be regarded as a deliberate choice, connected not only to the desire to preserve Antonius&#x2019; memory, but also to the particular messages associated with that specific statue.</p>
<p>In fact, statue bodies were powerful carriers of meaning. While the new statues set up in the Place of Palms wore the contemporary ceremonial toga, in the Tetrastoon rededication the emperor was shown wearing his garment draped in a way typical of the early imperial period. As Hans Peter L&#x2019;Orange first recognised, once the so-called <italic>contabulatio</italic> fashion of draping the toga was developed in the first half of the third century, the old form of toga did not disappear, but remained in use as a liturgical garment worn by priests when performing rituals of the Roman civic religion.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN170040"><sup>40</sup></xref> If, as Bert Smith has argued, the original statue was from the beginning an imperial depiction, it would have been quite natural to choose it for rededication in Late Antiquity. However, it seems to me not implausible that high functionaries of senatorial rank, such as the two Tatiani, had a good knowledge of the meaning of garments and <italic>insignia</italic> in Roman rituals.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN170041"><sup>41</sup></xref> If this were the case, then the statue body chosen for the monument set up by Antonius Tatianus in honour of Julian may be interpreted as a way to celebrate this emperor in his capacity as <italic>pontifex maximus</italic>, the high priest of the traditional Roman religion, a dedication that Julian is very likely to have appreciated. And, again, if this were the case, the rededication of such a monument to Theodosius by Tatianus&#x2019; son can be seen as a powerful statement in the negotiation of imperial behaviour. More than a generic petition of benevolence towards the pagans of the area, the dedication of a statue of the emperor in priestly dress may be interpreted as expressing the expectation, by a member of the pagan elite, that Theodosius, despite his personal Christian affiliation, would fulfil his pontifical duties towards the traditional religion through a policy of <italic>laissez-faire</italic>, as all Christian emperors before him had done. Subsequent events show that this negotiation failed. The chronological coincidence of Tatianus&#x2019; disgrace and condemnation with the prohibition of pagan cult practices by Theodosius has already been stressed by scholars, and I think that the Aphrodisias monument can add some new elements to the complex picture of that key moment of Roman history.</p>
<p>The head of Theodosius&#x2019; statue from the Tetrastoon shows some of the stylistic markers already mentioned: the regular face with harmonious proportions, the absence of any signs of age, and the almond-shaped eyes. However, if we compare it with the contemporary head of (probably) Arcadius from the Place of Palms, some differences are evident: the volume of Theodosius&#x2019; hair is much smaller, and the eyebrows are geometrically abstracted not as an arch but as a horizontal line. This is because the portrait from the Tetrastoon, unlike those from the Place of Palms, was reworked from an already existing head. As Martin Kovacs has recognised, its structure clearly depends on that of a third-century head, close to the first portrait type of Gallienus.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN170042"><sup>42</sup></xref> As was customary in reuse practice, the older head was carefully chosen because it was already built according to formal and stereometric principles similar to those of the planned new sculpture, so that the reworking could be made simpler, and have a better aesthetic result.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>As noted at the beginning, eclecticism was an essential element of Roman aesthetics from at least the late Republican period. Within this eclecticism, each stylistic trend returned to fashion many times in the history of imperial portraiture, bringing with it associations with earlier periods of Roman history chosen as models for contemporary political and artistic practices. The early Theodosian portraits aim at presenting the emperor as a super-human being, detached from earthly concerns, acting as an intermediary between God and the human world. The idealised classicising style provided efficient means to express these concepts. In its opposition to the strong, expressionist portraits of the Valentinians, Theodosius&#x2019; self-representation certainly looks back to the already classicising Constantinian face, but late fourth-century artists chose to express this new kind of imperial super-humanity by recurring to a wider range of stylistic models. This is a consequence, among other factors, of the choice of Constantinople as the main imperial residence. This meant that the official imperial portraits were now created by sculptors working in that city and educated in the local style. Theodosian portraiture presents some features, such as the slender proportions, the theatrical gaze, and the softness of facial structure, almost disappearing under the carefully polished surface, which were distinctive stylistic marks of Asian sculptors, heirs of a tradition which looked back to Hellenistic pathos and theatricality as well as to the Classical Attic models. This sort of neo-Hellenistic fashion had previously enjoyed an empire-wide success under Gallienus in the mid-third century. Constantine himself had resorted to similar aesthetics (including a probable imitation of Gallienus&#x2019; first portrait type) at the beginning of his reign, when he sought to distance himself from the tradition of tetrarchic imperial images.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN170043"><sup>43</sup></xref> However, Constantinian portraits still show a very concrete quality, conveyed through a plastically developed structure, which is no longer observable in the early Theodosian images. These are characterised by a greater degree of abstraction; the individual features are reduced to graphic elements attached to plain geometrical surfaces, while the elongated proportions and the highly refined polishing fully justify the name of &#x2018;subtle style&#x2019; (<italic>subtiler Stil</italic>) by which this tendency has been known since the studies of Hans Peter L&#x2019;Orange.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN170044"><sup>44</sup></xref></p>
<p>Theodosius&#x2019; classicising choice was at the same time contemporary, since it conveyed current ideas about the emperor and his political role, and retrospective, in that it entailed a continuous interplay of stylistic and ideological references to the past. Two different, but interrelated, phenomena provide the immediate frame of reference of Theodosian classicism. On the one hand, the importance of Classical and especially Hellenistic models, and the links with the tradition of ideal sculpture, can be interpreted as the consequence of the pre-eminence of Asian artists, particularly important for the development of a distinctive Constantinopolitan visual culture in the mid- and late fourth century. It is also significant, with respect to earlier periods, that almost half of the extant Theodosian portraits come precisely from this geographical area. On the other hand, the Theodosian style should also be interpreted in light of its relation to the previous classicistic waves in Roman portraiture, and the political messages attached to them. By choosing to be depicted in this particular way, Theodosius aims at presenting himself as a true heir to Constantine, through Constantine to Gallienus, and ultimately through them to Augustus, the founder of the Empire. Comparable historical associations also characterise the opposite stylistic tendency. The expressionist portrait of the strong, concrete, down-to-earth ruler goes from Caracalla, through the military emperors of the third century and the Tetrarchs, to those fourth-century rulers (like Licinius and Magnentius) who set themselves in opposition to Constantine and his dynasty, down to the Valentinians, and beyond.</p>
<p>The choice of the stylistic language used for imperial portraits thus depends on each ruler&#x2019;s options of legitimisation, and conveys the immediate expression of a specific political message. In an artistic context in which individualisation is apparently seen as much less interesting than it used to be in earlier periods, an essential part of each emperor&#x2019;s agenda is now emphatically stated in his portrait by ideally linking the new ruler to a given set of predecessors who are advertised as models. Of course, stylistic choices and the adoption of specific models had always been used, along with the rulers&#x2019; individual features, as powerful carriers of meaning in the genre of imperial portraiture. In the late antique period, however, the importance of style and models seems to increase, to the point that individual traits may be completely obliterated from imperial self-representation; the desired message is now conveyed by means of the subtle articulation, combination, and variation of a set of standardised pre-existing formulae. This peculiar ability of expressing new messages through a retrospective gaze can be recognised as one of the most distinctive characteristics of the Romans&#x2019; relation to their own visual culture; it entails the ability to convey new ideas and answer new needs by re-using and re-combining traditional stylistic ingredients. The application of this technique to the genre of imperial portraiture, in particular, allows, as late as the second half of the fourth century, the perpetuation of the fundamental ambiguity about the role of the Roman emperor, who was simultaneously a &#x2018;normal&#x2019; citizen chosen as supreme leader and a super-human being appointed with divine sanction; an ambiguity which will last long into the Christian Empire until the end of antiquity.</p>

<p>Things may have been partly different in monumental sculpture. The bronze colossal head in the Palazzo dei Conservatori (Roma, Musei Capitolini, inv. no. MC 1072), pertaining to Constantine&#x2019;s fourth portrait type, depicts in detail the sagging skin on the cheeks and around the mouth, as well as the wrinkles on the neck; but, due to the lack of comparative evidence, it is difficult to establish whether this insistence on the signs of ageing was typical for the genre of monumental sculpture, as opposed to coin portraits, or should rather be interpreted as an isolated choice of the sculptor or patrons of this specific statue. On this head see Fittschen, Zanker 1994, 152&#x2013;55, cat. no. 123; <italic>LSA</italic> 562.</p>

<p>Smith 1997, 178: &#x201C;The whole imperial portrait system of the Middle Empire, of type and replication, was a function and expression of the idea that the emperor was a person not different in principle from others. His portrait was known to be the emperor&#x2019;s because it was recognisable as of that particular person, whom the viewer knew (from constant exposure to versions of his official portrait) also happened to be emperor. The purpose of centrally-provided models and their use by portrait workshops around the Empire was thus to ensure the ruler&#x2019;s recognisability and identifiability.&#x201D;</p>

<p>On Julian&#x2019;s portraits see recently Guidetti 2015 and Garc&#x00ED;a Ruiz 2018. In Guidetti 2015, 21&#x2013;23 I argued that Julian&#x2019;s choice of growing a short beard soon after his proclamation as Augustus may be interpreted as a way to attach himself to the military style of self-representation adopted by the emperors of the third century up to the tetrarchic period. While this is certainly true, a more specific (and much more convincing) explanation has been suggested to me by Gavin Kelly in private conversation: in assimilating himself to an imperial image which had been fashionable until two generations earlier, Julian may be advertising his dynastic legitimacy through a direct reference to his imperial forefathers &#x2013; his grandfather Constantius (<italic>reg.</italic> 305&#x2013;306), his great-grandfather Maximian (<italic>reg.</italic> 285&#x2013;305), and the purported founder of the dynasty, Claudius Gothicus (<italic>reg.</italic> 268&#x2013;270), who was believed to have been Constantius&#x2019; great-uncle. In this way, Julian could advance his own dynastic claims, completely bypassing the other branch of the family, that of his uncle Constantine and his sons: as a descendant of Constantius&#x2019; marriage with Maximian&#x2019;s (adopted) daughter Theodora, Julian could claim an even better legitimacy than the Constantinian line, which descended from the low-status Helena. This argument could find further confirmation in the fact that Julian&#x2019;s brother Gallus, too, is described as having had a beard by the historian Ammianus Marcellinus (Amm. Marc. 14.11.28).</p>

<p>Smith&#x2019;s reconstruction of Licinius&#x2019; public image is mainly based on the colossal portrait head of this emperor found in the theatre of Ephesus (Wien, Kunsthistorisches Museum, Antikensammlung, inv. no. 932).

<p>The identification of the main group, formed by the three heads in Florence, Copenhagen, and Tivoli, was first proposed by Delbr&#x00FC;ck 1933, 178&#x2013;85; the portrait now in the Capitoline Museum was found in 1939 in the Forum Boarium in Rome, while the one in Vienne, originally identified by Delbr&#x00FC;ck as Magnentius, was correctly recognised as Valentinianic by Stichel 1982, 41&#x2013;44. See also von Sydow 1969, 73&#x2013;81; Meischner 1992. Johanning 2003, 91&#x2013;97 proposes for all these portraits a date in the mid-fifth century <sc>AD</sc>, a far-fetched hypothesis rightly rejected by Kovacs 2014, 66&#x2013;69.</p>

E 2951, probably identifiable with an empress of the Valentinianic dynasty, which shows the same energetic eyes and a similar flat, mask-like treatment of the facial features: Delbr&#x00FC;ck 1933, 169&#x2013;171; Stutzinger 1983, 444&#x2013;45, cat. no. 54; Wegner 1987, 119, cat. no. 9; Sena Chiesa 1990, 324&#x2013;325, cat. no. 5a.1c (S.

The date of <sc>AD</sc> 388 is granted by the inscription &#x201C;D(ominus) N(oster) Theodosius perpet(uus) Aug(ustus) ob diem felicissimum X.&#x201D; The attempt by Bl&#x00E1;zquez Mart&#x00ED;nez 2000, surprisingly accepted by several scholars (for example Kovacs 2014, 91), to date the <italic>missorium</italic> to <sc>AD</sc> 393 is in my opinion unnecessary. The search for a later date was prompted by the wrong assumption that Theodosius could not be depicted in such a pre-eminent position within the imperial college at a time when he was not yet the <italic>senior Augustus</italic>. In fact, Theodosius, although occupying the central position on the plate (quite understandably, I would say, given the fact that it is his anniversary which is being celebrated), is clearly not depicted as the <italic>senior Augustus</italic>. The latter, on the contrary, is identifiable without doubt with the young emperor on the left: he, and not the central figure, is the only member if the imperial college bearing the symbol of supreme sovereignty, i.e. the long sceptre; the dating provided by the inscription allows to identify him, correctly, as Valentinian <sc>II</sc>. One can cite for comparison the images of the Tetrarchs in the reliefs of the Arch of Galerius in Thessalonica and in the frescoes of the sanctuary of the imperial cult in Egyptian Thebes: in both cases all four emperors are virtually identical in their appearance, but only one of them, identifiable as Diocletian, holds the long sceptre (cf. Guidetti 2018, 14&#x2013;18).</p>

<title>Introduction<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180000"><sup>*</sup></xref></title>
<p>Maximus&#x2019; Letter to Valentinian <sc>II</sc>, preserved in the <italic>Collectio Avellana</italic>, is an important document because of its author, its content, and the circumstances in which it was produced. It was written by a usurper who had become <italic>Augustus</italic> and was condemned as a <italic>tyrannus</italic> after his fall,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180001"><sup>1</sup></xref> and it shows one emperor attacking another, albeit within the formalities of epistolary exchange between Augusti. It is highly likely that this was the first missive that Magnus Maximus directed personally to his colleague in Milan, three years after rising to power, and criticises the legitimate emperor on religious grounds. It is both a diplomatic and a polemical document, in which the Augustus of Trier, through criticism of the religious policy of Valentinian <sc>II</sc>, offers his personal vision of how a good <italic>princeps</italic> should fulfil his religious function. He wrote it after the conclusion of the so-called &#x2018;basilica crisis&#x2019; in Milan<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180002"><sup>2</sup></xref> in April 386 and before the outbreak of civil war (387).</p>
<p>Among the ancients, the significance of the imperial letter was recognised by Rufinus of Aquileia and Theodoret of Cyrus, who offer a legitimistic interpretation of the letter. They read it as a prologue to the invasion of Italy that occurred a year later, in 387. Rufinus was writing in 402/403 and had first-hand knowledge of the &#x2018;basilica crisis&#x2019; in Milan,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180003"><sup>3</sup></xref> and access to the letter after his arrival in Rome in 397.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180004"><sup>4</sup></xref> Maximus&#x2019; intention was to distance himself from the disgrace of tyranny and present himself as the legitimate emperor. In Rufinus&#x2019; view of events, the machinations and sieges of Justina, Maximus&#x2019; epistolary protest and Rome&#x2019;s conquest were interrelated.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180005"><sup>5</sup></xref> In 449/450, Theodoret, who does not rely on Rufinus in this matter,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180006"><sup>6</sup></xref> focused on the exhortatory and intimidating dimensions of the <italic>epistula</italic>, noting that Maximus had written to Valentinian to exhort him to end his attacks on piety and not abandon his paternal religion, threatening him with war if he did not yield.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180007"><sup>7</sup></xref> According to Theodoret, the threats were acted on immediately.</p>
<p>Through the historian from Cyrus we also know that Theodosius became aware of Maximus&#x2019; <italic>epistula</italic> and wrote to Valentinian in 387, after the latter fled Milan in the face of Maximus&#x2019; advance on Italy. In his stern letter, the Augustus of Constantinople traced a link between Maximus&#x2019; defence of orthodoxy and his power over Valentinian <sc>II</sc>. At the same time, he saw the weakness of Valentinian <sc>II</sc> in the face of his &#x2018;usurper&#x2019; as a sign and consequence of his philo-Arianism.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180008"><sup>8</sup></xref> The collector, or collectors, of the <italic>Avellana</italic>, compiled in Rome in the middle of the sixth century,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180009"><sup>9</sup></xref> likewise regarded the tyrant&#x2019;s letter as a remarkable document.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180010"><sup>10</sup></xref></p>
<p>However, the letter has received limited and secondary attention from scholars.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180011"><sup>11</sup></xref> The most recent contributions by McLynn and Humphries, specifically dedicated to analysis of the text, are in the process of being published.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180012"><sup>12</sup></xref></p>
<p>This paper seeks to analyse the two conflicting imperial images drawn by Magnus Maximus by examining his words and their relationship to the exceptional circumstances in which the letter was written, when the height of the the &#x2018;basilica crisis&#x2019; in Milan (385&#x2013;386) seemed to have passed, and a year before Maximus&#x2019; invasion of Italy (387). The text revolves around the religious function of the emperor and his intrusion into ecclesiastical matters, but also forms part of a series of initiatives in relation to the young-emperor undertaken by the court in Trier. In this respect, it is an example of diplomatic relations between Augusti, with the distinctive feature that the principles of collegiality and non-interference feature within the text of the letter alongside the characterisation of his peer as a persecutor.</p>
<p>The paper will begin by examining the letter&#x2019;s diplomatic precedents. It will then analyse the religious context, and in the third section the contents of the <italic>epistula</italic>, directly influenced by this context, in particular, the contrast between the figure of the orthodox emperor and the defender of the divine law, and that of the protector of heretics, presented as a persecuting tyrant.</p>
<p>It becomes clear that Maximus aimed to discredit Valentinian in his letter, to gain support in Milan, and reinforce his authority before Theodosius. The point of interest is how the roles of legitimate emperor and &#x2018;tyrant&#x2019; are reversed in a diplomatic text.</p>

<title>Rivalry and Diplomacy: The Image of Maximus in Ambrose&#x2019;s Letter 30 (Maur. 24)</title>
<p>In mid-386, the scandal of tyranny as contended by Rufinus did not weigh upon Maximus in political terms. He had been accepted as a peer in the empire by Theodosius, and by Valentinian himself in 384; and in 386, Maximus&#x2019; recognition as Augustus was unconditional.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180013"><sup>13</sup></xref> Nevertheless, his image in the public mind in Italy was far from one of acceptance, as reflected in a contemporary document which evinces the lack of harmony between Trier and Milan in autumn and winter 384/385: Ambrose&#x2019;s <italic>epistula</italic> 30 (Maur. 24), in which the bishop recounts his second <italic>legatio</italic> to Trier as Valentinian&#x2019;s representative. The doubts surrounding its authenticity<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180014"><sup>14</sup></xref> seem to have been resolved.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180015"><sup>15</sup></xref> Disregarding the bishop&#x2019;s efforts to highlight his own diplomatic activity, when in reality he himself offers evidence that the negotiations between Trier and Milan happened at the margins of his intervention in both the first and second embassies,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180016"><sup>16</sup></xref> the letter covers the points of conflict between the two imperial courts before the basilica crisis in Milan.</p>
<p>Some scholars<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180017"><sup>17</sup></xref> date Ambrose&#x2019;s second embassy to 386 and regard it as a reaction to Maximus&#x2019; <italic>epistula</italic> to Valentinian. This chronological perspective was refuted by Duval<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180018"><sup>18</sup></xref> using arguments shared and reinforced in this paper. In his preface to the letter, Ambrose alludes to the court&#x2019;s lack of interest in knowing the result of his first embassy and reveals that the <italic>expositio</italic> of the second mission was his own initiative.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180019"><sup>19</sup></xref> The theory that Ambrose had been sent by the court in Milan to Trier after receiving Maximus&#x2019; letter to deny in person any religious persecution in Milan does not seem compatible with the imperial indifference that Ambrose alleges. Furthermore, as we shall see, the matters discussed in Ambrose&#x2019;s <italic>epistula</italic> 30 bear no relation whatsoever to the questions posed by Maximus to Valentinian. On the contrary, Ambrose, in <italic>epistula</italic> 76 (Maur. 20) to Marcellina, written after Holy Week in 386, refers to events recounted in <italic>epistula</italic> 30,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180020"><sup>20</sup></xref> so it cannot post-date it. Questions of a different order also arise. The penultimate paragraph of the letter implies that Ambrose believed he would not get out of Trier alive. How could the bishop whose persecution in Milan had motivated Maximus&#x2019; letter to Valentinian fear for his life in Trier?<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180021"><sup>21</sup></xref> Ambrose attributes the preservation of Valentinian&#x2019;s <italic>regnum</italic> to Almighty God before the Augustus of Trier;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180022"><sup>22</sup></xref> is this affirmation by Ambrose in 386 compatible with the contents of his <italic>epistula</italic> to Valentinian and with his <italic>Sermo contra Auxentium</italic>, texts which were written in the same year?</p>
<p>I propose not only that the chronological order of the letters should be reversed, and Ambrose&#x2019;s second embassy and <italic>epistula</italic> 30 dated to the autumn and winter of 384/385, after the debate on the <italic>ara Victoriae</italic> and before Holy Week in 385,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180023"><sup>23</sup></xref> but also that Maximus&#x2019; letter should be read in the light of the contents of Ambrose&#x2019;s <italic>epistula</italic> 30 to Valentinian.</p>
<p>Ambrose concludes the <italic>expositio</italic> on the second <italic>legatio</italic> in Gaul by advising Valentinian <sc>II</sc> to remain vigilant when faced with a man who hid war under a veneer of peace.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180024"><sup>24</sup></xref> Zosimus attributes similar intentions to Theodosius when he indicates that although he accepted that Maximus was emperor, he was preparing in secret to wage war against him.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180025"><sup>25</sup></xref> However, Maximus&#x2019; words, reproduced by the bishop, cannot be read as an ultimatum. <italic>Simulatio</italic> was a standard device in the characterisation of a bad emperor. By using it, the bishop aimed to disguise the results of an uneven performance in his first embassy, which had prompted Maximus to make formal complaints (<italic>criminationes</italic>) against Ambrose to the court of Milan. The letter is our main source for the diplomatic exchanges between Trier and Milan from 383 to 385, but also provides a summary of the image of Maximus that was circulating in Milan and which the Augustus of Trier saw first hand during the course of his interview with the bishop.</p>
<p>After violently disposing of Gratian in 383, Maximus had opted for a diplomatic approach in his contacts with the Milanese court. Crossing the Alps was a difficult enterprise, as the disgraceful episode with Domninus in 387 reveals,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180026"><sup>26</sup></xref> and Theodosius was inclined to protect Valentinian, which obliged Maximus to develop parallel contacts with Constantinople.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180027"><sup>27</sup></xref></p>
<p>The usurper&#x2019;s peace proposal to the Milanese court was accompanied by a request to relocate Valentinian <sc>II</sc> and his mother Justina to Trier.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180028"><sup>28</sup></xref> Under the pretext of guardianship of the young western emperor, Maximus hoped by diplomatic means to subordinate Gratian&#x2019;s territories to the usurper and to control the Milanese court. Winning the support of the Roman senate and the financial resources which came with control over Italy and Rome would be the next step.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180029"><sup>29</sup></xref> Both parties wished to avoid war in autumn of 383, and the first ambassadors, the <italic>comes</italic> Victor and Bishop Ambrose, crossed paths on their journeys.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180030"><sup>30</sup></xref> However, the negotiations separately undertaken in Milan and Trier may have addressed different subjects. Surprised by Maximus&#x2019; demands and with no time to consult with Milan, Ambrose promised the arrival of the heir and his mother at the right time,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180031"><sup>31</sup></xref> while Victor returned from Milan with a refusal to listen to Maximus&#x2019; petition. The ambassador was the image of the emperor who sent him to negotiate. The court of Milan, probably more confident in its position because of Theodosius&#x2019; support, prepared to send a new delegation which would formally ratify the message send by the <italic>comes</italic> Victor to Maximus. Milan did not wait for Ambrose&#x2019;s arrival, since the bishop said he had met the new <italic>legati</italic> on his return journey.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180032"><sup>32</sup></xref> The exchange of embassies was not without moments of tension. Ambrose was held in Trier while Victor returned and Maximus&#x2019; brother, Marcellinus, then in Milan, could only return with Valentinian&#x2019;s authorisation.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180033"><sup>33</sup></xref></p>
<p>Maximus felt misled and obstructed in his military approach by Ambrose&#x2019;s false promises, and sent a written protest to Milan with <italic>criminationes</italic> against the bishop, who explicitly recognises that that was the reason for his second embassy to Trier.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180034"><sup>34</sup></xref> Ambrose carried a <italic>rescriptum</italic> in which the Milanese court responded to Maximus&#x2019; letter, disowned Ambrose&#x2019;s promises, and probably, following Theodosius&#x2019; example, implicitly recognised Maximus as an equal.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180035"><sup>35</sup></xref> Maximus&#x2019; lack of ceremony when he received Ambrose in the consistorium again was wholly justified. When Ambrose looked back in retrospect in 392, in his <italic>De obitu Valentiniani</italic>, and recognised that in his second embassy to Trier he had sought peace, as well as to reclaim Gratian&#x2019;s remains,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180036"><sup>36</sup></xref> he was admitting that his diplomatic dealings had been at the point of endangering that very peace.</p>
<p>Alongside the narrative of a complex diplomatic game, Ambrose&#x2019;s <italic>epistula</italic> 30 (Maur. 24) conveys a shameful image of Maximus derived from his comparison with Valentinian and Theodosius: he is represented as a wrathful tyrant who did not respect diplomatic protocol (2); an enemy of the Romans for attempting to lead barbarians against Italy,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180037"><sup>37</sup></xref> while Valentinian kept them away from the Gauls (8); cruel for having ordered the murder of Gratian and refusing to hand over his <italic>reliquae</italic>, in contrast to the pious Valentinian who had returned his brother to him (9&#x2013;10); and vengeful for punishing Gratian&#x2019;s followers after his death while Theodosius received them and showered them with gifts and honours (11).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180038"><sup>38</sup></xref> The strongest attack on Maximus&#x2019; image, however, comes at the end of the letter. Ambrose&#x2019;s refusal to take communion with the bishops who sought the deaths of the Priscillianists in Trier,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180039"><sup>39</sup></xref> and his ensuing expulsion, which coincided with the exile of the bishop Hyginus, was tantamount to questioning Maximus&#x2019; orthodoxy and portraying him as a persecutor of bishops (12). Attributing <italic>simulatio</italic> to Maximus was the logical culmination of Ambrose&#x2019;s <italic>epistula</italic> to Valentinian (13).</p>
<p>There is no evidence that Maximus could read Ambrose&#x2019;s report to Valentinian, which undermined his image not only in Milan, but also in Rome. The tone of the dialogue with the bishop and its discourteous conclusion were, however, eloquent indications of the version that Ambrose would give later. To this should be added, at Maximus&#x2019;s expense, that the audience had taken place in the consistorium of Trier.</p>

<title>The Religious Background: Valentinian <sc>II</sc> and the Persecution in Milan (385&#x2013;386)</title>
<p>Maximus&#x2019; letter <italic>CA</italic> 39 was composed in this diplomatic and epistolary context, after the confrontation between the bishop and the court of Milan in 385&#x2013;386 about the use of the city&#x2019;s basilicas.</p>
<p>As we know, in 385 Ambrose had opposed the wish of the court of Justina and Valentinian <sc>II</sc> to use a basilica, most likely the <italic>Portiana, extra muros</italic>,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180040"><sup>40</sup></xref> to celebrate the liturgy of Holy Week in the presence of the emperor,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180041"><sup>41</sup></xref> but without Ambrose as celebrant. Although the <italic>Portiana</italic> was not under the bishop&#x2019;s jurisdiction, due to its location,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180042"><sup>42</sup></xref> accepting the imperial initiative<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180043"><sup>43</sup></xref> would have entailed the marginalisation of the bishop in his own city. This would have made imperial misgivings about Ambrose&#x2019;s doctrinal positions visible to the <italic>populus</italic>, attracted by the procession and attendance of the imperial family at the celebration of Easter, which would have weakened the bishop&#x2019;s authority as guide of the whole Milanese Christian community.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180044"><sup>44</sup></xref> On receiving the letter of invitation to the court to discuss the matter, Ambrose had called upon the people to defend not only religious unity but also his authority, and had managed to mobilise the Nicaeans, who accompanied him to the palace, prepared to force their way in and occupy the <italic>Portiana</italic> in response.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180045"><sup>45</sup></xref> When the troops sent by a <italic>comes militaris</italic> could not prevent the Milanese Nicaeans from committing what could be classified as an act close to sedition, it was necessary to appeal to the bishop to avoid disorder spreading. In exchange for his peace-making, the court was obliged to renounce its own use of the basilica.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the emperor could not appear subordinate to the bishop. A little later, the chancellery of Valentinian <sc>II</sc> promulgated a law to avoid the recurrence of such a situation, and to restrict Ambrose&#x2019;s sphere of action to his congregation. In essence, the law of 23 January 386 (<italic>Cod. Theod.</italic> 16.1.4) authorised meetings of whoever confessed the faith endorsed in Rimini in 359 and in Constantinople in 360, and ruled seditious and subject to capital punishment anyone who attempted to cause a disturbance, believing that they were the only ones who had the right to hold assemblies.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180046"><sup>46</sup></xref></p>
<p>Within the framework of this law, in late January or early February, the Milanese court attempted to neutralise Ambrose&#x2019;s influence. The bishop was summoned to engage in a debate with the Arian Mercurinus Auxentius in the consistorium, in the presence of the emperor as arbitrator. Afraid that a contentious debate <italic>de fide</italic> would become a trial whose outcome would be unpredictable and which could bring about his removal from Milan and the installation of a replacement, Ambrose avoided direct confrontation with his rival, disobeyed the imperial <italic>mandatum</italic> to present himself in court, opting instead to communicate his decision to Valentinian <sc>II</sc> by letter.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180047"><sup>47</sup></xref> In the missive, Ambrose demonstrated his greater confidence in the people as judge and invited Auxentius to debate their differences in church and before the faithful.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180048"><sup>48</sup></xref> To punish his refusal, the emperor responded by ordering him to leave the city.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180049"><sup>49</sup></xref> Soldiers tried to expel him by force when they surrounded the basilica, while the bishop appealed directly to the faithful in a homily weeks before Easter 386.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180050"><sup>50</sup></xref></p>
<p>These are the events that Ambrose recalls in his <italic>Sermo contra Auxentium</italic>, while he endured his first siege, as part of the palace conspiracy devised to damage him.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180051"><sup>51</sup></xref> In his <italic>oratio</italic>, he alludes to two accusations the court made against him. The first is related to the question of the church&#x2019;s gold:<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180052"><sup>52</sup></xref> the bishop was supposed to have bought the will of the Nicaeans with gold.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180053"><sup>53</sup></xref> The second was that he had subjugated the will of the Milanese Nicaean people, stirring up fanaticism with his provocative hymns (<italic>carmina</italic>), said to have the power of magical formulae.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180054"><sup>54</sup></xref> The accusations which had spread and which Ambrose incorporated into his homily were that he controlled the will of the Nicaean people with his hymns, directed their opinion towards orthodox Christology and drove them to seditious and violent attitudes, taking advantage of his spiritual leadership.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180055"><sup>55</sup></xref></p>
<p>Coercing the will of the Milanese people with gold and hymns was not a minor matter, bearing in mind the abovementioned law of January 386, and correlates with a third accusation levelled against the bishop, the accusation that he is a <italic>tyrannus</italic>. Ambrose&#x2019;s letter to Marcellina (<italic>Ep</italic>. 76. [Maur. 20]) narrates the events of Holy Week in 386, when Valentinian <sc>II</sc> claimed the <italic>basilica noua</italic> instead of the <italic>Portiana</italic>,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180056"><sup>56</sup></xref> which led to the second siege of Ambrose<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180057"><sup>57</sup></xref> in the <italic>basilica uetus</italic>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180058"><sup>58</sup></xref> In that letter, Ambrose alludes to the allegation made by the <italic>notarius</italic> sent by the court to negotiate, who accused him of <italic>maiestas</italic> for having disobeyed imperial orders. The bishop was also suspected of arrogating despotic power for having incited the <italic>populus</italic><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180059"><sup>59</sup></xref> to revolt.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180060"><sup>60</sup></xref> The letter, like all Ambrose&#x2019;s documents on the basilica crises, should be read through the lens of the bishop&#x2019;s strategy of confrontation with the court. Leaving aside the rhetoric of resistance, the accusation of <italic>tyrannus</italic> should nevertheless be accepted as plausible and consistent with the events described. The death threat issued by Calligonus, the <italic>praepositus sacri cubiculi</italic>, against Ambrose once the emperor had ordered the soldiers to abandon the basilica<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180061"><sup>61</sup></xref> may be seen as an indication that the court perceived the efficacy of the bishop&#x2019;s methods of persuasion to be an impediment to the necessary performance of Valentinian&#x2019;s ceremonial function.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180062"><sup>62</sup></xref> As in the previous phases of the crisis, the main bone of contention between the representatives of the court and the bishop, all of whom had turned the liturgy into a space of confrontation, was the power Ambrose exercised over the <italic>populus</italic>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180063"><sup>63</sup></xref> The suspicion that the popular will was being manipulated with gold and &#x2018;magical&#x2019; hymns was part of a strategy used by the court that Ambrose himself described as <italic>persecution</italic>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180064"><sup>64</sup></xref></p>

<title>The Defender of the <bold>lex catholica</bold> and the Persecutor: Imperial Images in Conflict</title>
<p>The image of the persecutor-emperor had been established since Lactantius.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180065"><sup>65</sup></xref> Nero, Decius, Galerius, and Valens himself in the recent past had set abominable precedents in this regard. Maximus did not waste the opportunity that presented itself and used the events in Milan to address Valentinian <sc>II</sc> personally by letter. Moreover, the political situation favoured the aspirations of the Augustus of Trier. When Maximus wrote his letter to Valentinian <sc>II</sc> after Holy Week of 386, he was able to present himself as a defender of orthodoxy against the heresy in the West, in his strict enforcement of laws against the Manichaeans and the crime of <italic>maleficium</italic>, and in alliance with the Nicaean episcopate. Evodius, Maximus&#x2019; praetorian prefect, whom he appointed consul in 386, was accepted in the East as the legitimate consular equal of Theodosius&#x2019; infant son Honorius.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180066"><sup>66</sup></xref> The prefect had acted as a judge and found the Priscillianists on trial in Trier guilty.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180067"><sup>67</sup></xref> Bearing in mind Theodosius&#x2019; role in the fight against heresy, Maximus&#x2019; actions in defence of orthodoxy in the trials against the Priscillianists in Trier and his full recognition by the court of Constantinople may have been interrelated.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180068"><sup>68</sup></xref></p>
<p>As Honor&#x00E9; suggested,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180069"><sup>69</sup></xref> the author of the letter was probably Maximus himself<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180070"><sup>70</sup></xref> and, although the recipient was Valentinian <sc>II</sc>, it was written for a specifically Milanese audience. It may also have had a wider distribution afterwards, including in Rome and Constantinople. The content of the text unfolds around two lines of argument which shape two imperial images. On one hand, Maximus seeks credibility for his repeated assertion that he was not acting as an <italic>inimicus</italic>, but as a pious adviser who aimed to persuade the young emperor to correct his religious policy.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180071"><sup>71</sup></xref> He thus situated himself in a position of superiority<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180072"><sup>72</sup></xref> and averted any suspicion of aggression. On the other hand, however, through a selective and tendentious presentation of events, he made Valentinian appear as though he were a persecutor of the Nicaeans, a protector of Arians, isolated and impious compared to his father, a tyrant from a Christian perspective.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180073"><sup>73</sup></xref> Although Maximus was the &#x2018;usurper&#x2019;, the tyrant in the letter is Gratian&#x2019;s legitimate successor. The religious delegitimisation of Valentinian entailed his political delegitimisation.</p>
<p>Maximus deliberately omits any reference to previous diplomatic contacts that comprise the real context of hostility in which he was writing. Nor in his first direct contact with Valentinian does he try to legitimise his ascent in providential terms. This was a prominent theme in his letter to Pope Siricius,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180074"><sup>74</sup></xref> written at practically the same time,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180075"><sup>75</sup></xref> where he discusses his relationship with the divinity in a public document. In his communication with Valentinian <sc>II</sc> he avoided delicate questions, such as his role in Gratian&#x2019;s death,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180076"><sup>76</sup></xref> and his refusal to return his remains, matters which could alienate him from the Nicaean community in Milan. He addresses the narrative of the religious question directly in the preface and establishes an antithesis between Maximus and Valentinian and between their respective territories. It was the <italic>catholicae legis turbatio atque conuulsio</italic> in the imperial <italic>pars</italic> under Valentinian&#x2019;s control that prompted Maximus to write, which amounted to claiming that in his <italic>pars Imperii</italic> the <italic>lex catholica</italic> was safe. The religious battle-lines were drawn up on these terms.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180077"><sup>77</sup></xref></p>
<p>Maximus carefully selects the events that illustrate the impious actions of Valentinian <sc>II</sc>, which we know in detail from the Ambrosian documents that have been studied (<italic>Ep</italic>. 75 [Maur. 21]; <italic>Ep</italic>. 75a [Maur. 21a|] and <italic>Ep</italic>. 76 [Maur. 20]), although he attributes his knowledge of events to rumour (<italic>dicuntur, audio enim</italic>). He begins by attributing the violence against the Catholic churches to the pro-Arian law of January 386 (<italic>Cod. Theod.</italic> 16. 1.4), to which he alludes summarily (<italic>nouis clementiae tuae edictis</italic>). The violent acts that made it possible to criminalise the young Valentinian, depicting him as a frenzied, impious and avaricious emperor, were the siege of the priests in the basilicas, the imposition of a fine, and the introduction of capital punishment.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180078"><sup>78</sup></xref> The consequence was the subversion of the <italic>lex sanctissima</italic> in the name of an unknown law. The letter makes no mention of Ambrose, who had been the <italic>sacerdos</italic> under siege and threatened with death by the <italic>praepositus sacri cubiculi</italic>, Calligonus. Nor does it identify the recipient of the fine, the <italic>corpus mercatorum</italic>, which was a victim of an extremely steep financial penalty to be paid within three days.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180079"><sup>79</sup></xref> The Milanese audience knew these details and no effort was made to repeat the bishop&#x2019;s speech, but instead to appear as the defender of the Nicaean community in order to discredit Valentinian&#x2019;s religious function by emphasising the seriousness of these events: <italic>hoc quam graue sit, poteris intueri, si dei magnitudinem volueris cogitare</italic>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180080"><sup>80</sup></xref></p>
<p>Although there were many forces interested in supporting Valentinian <sc>II</sc> in response to Maximus&#x2019; interventions,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180081"><sup>81</sup></xref> including Theodosius,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180082"><sup>82</sup></xref> Maximus reversed the roles to bring the Milanese emperor&#x2019;s isolation into focus, translating his theological solitude to the political sphere. According to the letter&#x2019;s author, Valentinian <sc>II</sc> lacked religious allies in the West, which was the territory disputed between Milan and Trier. He omitted any reference to the situation in the East or to Theodosius, who is not mentioned in the <italic>epistula</italic>. Nicaean unity was dominant in both Italy and Africa, territories controlled by Valentinian, as well as in Maximus&#x2019;s <italic>pars</italic> which, he deliberately recalls, included Gaul, Aquitania, and <italic>omnis Hispania</italic>. Not even <italic>uenerabilis</italic> Rome followed the emperor, despite being located in Valentinian&#x2019;s <italic>pars</italic>. The author anticipates any objection, indicating that the only territory that had dissented, Illyricum, had suffered a severe divine punishment. Maximus cites as an example the recent defeat of the Arian Mursa, which had been the imperial seat of the Homoean Valens.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180083"><sup>83</sup></xref> With the calculating allusion to Mursa, Maximus warned that the emperor&#x2019;s impiety could put the Empire at risk: &#x2018;<italic>Periculose, mihi crede, diuina temptantur</italic>&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180084"><sup>84</sup></xref> One of the foundations of imperial ideology, which linked the unity of the Empire with religious unanimity, had been subverted by the emperor himself. In his letter to Valentinian in 386, Ambrose had used the same argument concerning the emperor&#x2019;s theological isolation in claiming that both the Gauls and Hispanias followed the <italic>fides Nicaena</italic>, which Theodosius himself had approved. After the basilica crisis, the Nicaean &#x2018;usurper&#x2019; was closer to Theodosius, who had promulgated the <italic>Cunctos populos</italic> (<italic>Cod. Theod.</italic> 16.1.2. 380) than was the legitimate <italic>princeps</italic>, whose religious policy has put the security of the Empire at risk.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180085"><sup>85</sup></xref></p>
<p>Finally, by comparing Valentinian <sc>II</sc> with his father,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180086"><sup>86</sup></xref> Maximus attacked one of the foundations of the Milanese regime, which was dynastic legitimacy based on parentage, and left open the question of whether a heretic emperor could be considered legitimate. The young emperor had destroyed continuity by separating himself from the religious policy of his father, Valentinian <sc>I</sc>, who is invoked as an <italic>exemplum</italic>. The <italic>mutatio</italic> was so great that those who had once been considered priests were now to be judged sacrilegious.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180087"><sup>87</sup></xref> In this case, Maximus again avoids mentioning the name of Ambrose, the greatest victim of the religious <italic>mutatio</italic> introduced by Valentinian <sc>II</sc>. It was precisely Valentinian&#x2019;s split from his father&#x2019;s religious policy that had been one of the fundamental arguments used by Ambrose in his letter to the young Augustus of Milan. In the same letter, Ambrose recalled that Valentinian I had approved his appointment as bishop.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180088"><sup>88</sup></xref></p>
<p>Invoking the memory of Valentinian <sc>I</sc> was not done disinterestedly, it was intended to cause an effect: to emphasise the contrast between the religious peace of his period and the <italic>imago persecutionis</italic> which his son&#x2019;s decisions could provoke, with their repercussions of <italic>discordia, contentio</italic> and <italic>crebra et pestifera seditio</italic>, the antithesis of doctrinal and political unity.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180089"><sup>89</sup></xref></p>
<p>Faced with an emperor who divides and persecutes, Maximus adopts the role of father and counsellor who attempts to rectify the young emperor&#x2019;s wrongful religious conduct, a strategy that meant asserting himself as an <italic>exemplum</italic> of the correct fulfilment of religious function. First, it was the duty of the emperor to protect the churches and to guarantee that they should remain in orthodox hands, so he advises Valentinian <sc>II</sc> to return all Italy, venerable Rome, and the remaining provinces to their churches and priests.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180090"><sup>90</sup></xref> Although the dispute for control of the basilicas had been limited to Milan, Maximus widens the emperor/bishop <italic>contentio</italic> to all Valentinian&#x2019;s <italic>pars</italic>, using an expression (<italic>Italiam omnem et uenerabilem Romam ceterasque prouincias suis ecclesiis, suis sacerdotibus reddas</italic>) that recalled the Theodosian laws against heresy.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180091"><sup>91</sup></xref> It was probably intended to try to annul the law of 386 by which Valentinian <sc>II</sc> had authorised the Arians to meet.</p>
<p>The second piece of advice referred to the role that the emperor should play in ecclesiastical conflicts. Maximus urged the Milanese Augustus not to intervene (<italic>neque te medius interseras</italic>), so that those who dissented from the <italic>catholica ecclesia</italic> through their Arian <italic>interpretatio</italic> should be the ones to correct their course.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180092"><sup>92</sup></xref> In contrast to what Valentinian <sc>II</sc> had attempted to do, portraying himself as a judge in the <italic>certatio</italic> between Mercurinus Auxentius and Ambrose, the emperor should not intervene in heretical disputes and should leave their resolution to the priests and Catholic churches.</p>
<p>At first glance, it may seem a surprising piece of advice from the Augustus who had condemned Priscillian of Avila and his most committed followers to death in 385.

Having received the <italic>gesta</italic> of the case, which recorded Priscillian&#x2019;s confession of <italic>maleficium</italic>, he considered it necessary to condemn Priscillian and his followers to death, in strict application of the law against the crime of magic.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180098"><sup>98</sup></xref> Ambrose himself, during his second <italic>legatio</italic> to Trier, which coincided with the trials, had verified the alliance between Maximus and the bishops, in which the emperor tried to include the ambassador from the Milanese court.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180099"><sup>99</sup></xref></p>
<p>In delegating to the bishops, Maximus had shown himself to be scrupulous in the application of the law, according to which religious cases were the exclusive competence of the ecclesiastical sphere.

<p>Maximus would repeat the same argument in his letter to Pope Siricius in Rome that same year. The letter responded to a query from Siricius about a certain Agroecius, who had been improperly promoted to the status of presbyter. Maximus asserted that Catholic priests should be the judges.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180104"><sup>104</sup></xref> &#x201C;What greater respect could I show our Catholic religion?&#x201D; the Augustus of Trier asks rhetorically. In the same letter, Maximus expanded on his vision of the role of the emperor in relation to <italic>fides catholica</italic>: it should remain <italic>illaesa et inuiolabilis</italic>, with all the bishops in agreement (<italic>concordantibus uniuersis sacerdotibus</italic>) and serving God. Any <italic>dissenssio</italic> should be eliminated.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180105"><sup>105</sup></xref> Based on these beliefs, Maximus related the strictly technical terms of his intervention in the Priscillian cause to the bishop of Rome.</p>
<p>Maximus adapted Ambrose&#x2019;s dispute with the Milanese court to his own political ends. The bishop had come out victor in the struggle for control over the basilicas and could be a powerful ally in Milan. In fact, Ambrose maintained an ominous silence during the year in which Maximus occupied the imperial residence in Milan after his invasion of Italy.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180106"><sup>106</sup></xref> It is unlikely that he wrote anything during that year. If he did write, he excluded it from his published legacy.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN180107"><sup>107</sup></xref> Moreover, the chronological coincidence of the Letter to Valentinian <sc>II</sc> and that to Pope Siricius suggests that in 386 Maximus undertook a peaceful and diplomatic effort to gain support in Italy before his invasion. The letter from Siricius may have encouraged Maximus to address the two seats of power simultaneously. Should this be the case, the bearer of <italic>CA</italic> 40 could plausibly have delivered a copy of <italic>CA</italic> 39 to the bishop of Rome as proof of Maximus&#x2019;s support of the Nicene faith and his defence of non-interference by the emperor in ecclesiastical conflicts.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Maximus&#x2019; letter to Valentinian <sc>II</sc>, written after April 386, is a diplomatic text, but does not contain a single positive association or assessment of the recipient.</p>
<p>The Augustus of Trier uses various techniques to undermine the image of the legitimate Augustus and to represent him as a violent, avaricious, isolated emperor who persecutes Nicaeans and has betrayed his father&#x2019;s religious policy. Based on the principles of imperial ideology articulated by Eusebius, he was a danger to the empire. In contrast, Maximus is depicted as the defender of orthodoxy and religious peace, and guarantor of the exclusive right of the Nicaeans to the churches and of the priests to resolve their disagreements internally. The roles of &#x2018;usurper&#x2019; and the emperor are reversed.</p>
<p>In his letter, Maximus strove to combat the image of the wrathful, impious and tyrannical usurper which had been constructed in the courtly settings of Milan and was reflected in Ambrose&#x2019;s <italic>epistula</italic> 30, and to build an alliance with the Nicaean cohorts that could give him a decisive influence in Milan and, by extension, in Rome and Constantinople. The implicit defence of the bishop who had twice represented the interests of Milan to Trier, and who had later been persecuted by that same court, was the shortest route to denigrating Valentinian <sc>II</sc>, drawing a contrast between the two imperial images and achieving credibility by articulating his request in an amicable way. Without any shadow of a doubt, the letter to Valentinian <sc>II</sc> was written by an <italic>inimicus</italic>.</p>

<p>Wisdom, philanthropy, mildness, forgiveness, courage &#x2026; These are some of the virtues that a Roman emperor was expected to embody and that pervaded late antique imperial speeches. However, what about anger and other passions that implied self-control and the management of emotions? Mastering the actions provoked by these emotions played a relevant role when emperors were publicly mocked or had to deal with violent expressions of dissatisfaction towards their policies. What did Julian feel when he lived in Antioch knowing that his habits, mannerisms, and behaviour had become laughing stock among locals? What did Theodosius think of the Thessalonians or the Antiochenes when he heard of the riotous acts that had taken place in those important cities? Most of the time the emperor would patiently sit and be addressed by a bishop, a philosopher, or a sophist who had come before him to ask for forgiveness, while he would struggle to conceal his amusement at the attempts of the speaker to walk the tightrope between making his points and ticking all the boxes of a typical imperial speech. Boredom, tiredness, or scepticism at what was being said would be other reactions that the emperor would experience after hearing for the thousandth time <italic>oh basileu</italic> followed by common topics intended to curry favour and to make amends.</p>
<p>Some of these emotions were probably experienced by the emperor Theodosius when hearing the events of the Riot of the Statues in Antioch <sc>AD</sc> 387. Contemporary sources show how the emperor Theodosius was praised as well as rebuked, shared tears of sorrow and repentance, and was moved to pity by the hymns sung by children. Such a collection of highly emotional reactions demands a literary and historical interpretation capable of contextualising Theodosius&#x2019; political and emotional responses to the Riot of the Statues. Therefore, in what follows I will briefly sketch out the main incidents of the Riot and then I will proceed to explore the accounts of contemporary authors (two Christians, John Chrysostom and Ambrose of Milan, and a pagan, Libanius of Antioch) as well as of later historians (again, both Christian &#x2013; Sozomen and Theodoret &#x2013; and pagan &#x2013; Zosimus) that inform us of Theodosius&#x2019; behaviour in order to determine how their handling of Theodosius&#x2019; reactions was related to their own political and religious agendas. In this context, particular attention will be paid to how the sources reflected on the anger experienced by Theodosius both as a catalyst of a set of imperial virtues and as a central element of the instrumentalisation of the figure of the emperor.</p>
<p>Our knowledge of the Riot of the Statues in Antioch <sc>AD</sc> 387 relies on the extremely biased accounts provided by John Chrysostom&#x2019;s twenty four homilies and Libanius&#x2019; five speeches on the tumult. Despite their differences, if we combine these two sources a relatively complete picture of the main incidents can emerge.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN190001"><sup>1</sup></xref> In February 387, the emperor Theodosius imposed an extraordinary tax in order to commemorate his son and his own anniversary as emperor, or to financially support his military enterprises against barbarians and usurpers. Once the decree was read in the <italic>bouleut&#x00E9;rion</italic> of Antioch, the protests of <italic>honorati</italic> and <italic>curiales</italic> gave way to an increasingly aggressive and spontaneous demonstration that soon gathered a mass of infuriated Antiochenes. At this point, Libanius&#x2019; version makes clear that the theatrical claque played a central role in the raging escalation of violence that ended with the destruction of public spaces. The climax of the Riot came with the stoning, desecration, and tearing down of the statues and portraits of the Imperial family. Once the stormy incidents were over, the <italic>comes Orientis</italic> arrested and executed some citizens amid the panic and flight of a good number of Antiochenes. When news of the Riot reached the emperor Theodosius, he sent the <italic>magister officiorum</italic> Caesarius and the <italic>magister militum</italic> Hellebichus to take care of the ensuing investigation. It was then that, according to John Chrysostom&#x2019;s telling, one of the bishops of the city &#x2013; Flavian &#x2013; went to Constantinople to try to assuage the emperor&#x2019;s wrath. By contrast, Libanius states that it was the <italic>magister officiorum</italic> Caesarius who achieved the emperor&#x2019;s forgiveness after presenting his exonerating reports in Constantinople.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN190002"><sup>2</sup></xref> In the end, Theodosius forgave Antioch and cancelled the precautionary punishments he had imposed on the city &#x2013; the closure of the public baths and the hippodrome, the cancellation of the distribution of food, and the loss of the status of metropolis.</p>
<p>Let us start our exploration of the use of Theodosius&#x2019; image in the context of the Riot with Chrysostom&#x2019;s <italic>De Statuis</italic>, a corpus of twenty-four homilies of widely varied content.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN190003"><sup>3</sup></xref> The scattered references to the Riot alternate with Christian teachings and admonitions intending to show Antioch as a major Christian centre capable of sheltering her inhabitants during a period of anxiety and fear (<italic>Hom</italic>. X.2): &#x201C;Where indeed, besides, will you hear the things upon which you meditate here? Were you to go to the bench of justice? Quarrels and contentions are there! Or into the council-chamber? There is anxious thought about political matters! Or to your home? (&#x2026;) Or were thou to go to the conferences and debates of the forum? Everything there is earthly and corruptible! (&#x2026;) But here on the contrary everything relates to heaven, and heavenly things; to our soul, to our life.&#x201D;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN190004"><sup>4</sup></xref> Chrysostom&#x2019;s claims that Antioch can find protection and solace from Theodosius&#x2019; wrath because of her Christian roots saturate his corpus of homilies on the Riot, including a reminder of the key role of Antioch in the development of early Christianity (<italic>Hom</italic>. <sc>XVII</sc>): &#x201C;Do you wish to learn the dignity of your city? Do you wish to its ancestry? I will tell it exactly; not only that you may, but that you may also emulate. What then is after all the dignity of this city of ours? <italic>It came to pass, that the disciples were first called Christians at</italic> (Acts 11: 26).&#x201D;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN190005"><sup>5</sup></xref></p>
<p>Chrysostom&#x2019;s strategy unfolds within this framework that links Antioch&#x2019;s illustrious Christian pedigree with the spiritual comfort that the Church offered in the aftermath of the Riot. In doing so, Chrysostom implies that the justified wrath of Theodosius at the outrageous events could only be held back by the intervention of Christian figures, especially the bishop of Antioch, Flavian. In one of the homilies on the Riot, Chrysostom describes the bishop&#x2019;s weapons to fight for Antioch (<italic>Hom</italic>. <sc>III</sc>): &#x201C;He [Flavian] too has his breast-plate, that of righteousness. He too has his girdle, that of truth, and sandals of much greater dignity, those of the Gospel of peace. He too has a sword, not of iron, but of the Spirit; he too has a crown resting on his head. This panoply is the more splendid. The weapons are grander, the license of speech greater, and mightier the strength. So that from the weight of his authority, and from his own greatness of soul; and more than all the rest, from the hope which he has in God, he will address the emperor with much freedom and much discretion.&#x201D;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN190006"><sup>6</sup></xref></p>
<p>The climax of Chrysostom&#x2019;s narrative can be found in homily <sc>XXI</sc> of the corpus of <italic>De Statuis</italic> in which Flavian&#x2019;s journey to Constantinople to appease Theodosius&#x2019; heart is detailed (<italic>Hom</italic>. <sc>XXI</sc>): &#x201C;he exposed his life for all; and while there were many things to hinder him, as the winter, his age, the feast, and not less than these, his sister, then at her last breath, he raised himself above all these obstacles.&#x201D; Next Chrysostom highlights Flavian&#x2019;s tactful strategy to remind Theodosius of the imperial virtues advanced by Chrysostom in previous homilies from the set of <italic>De Statuis</italic>: philanthropy, faithfulness, and a willingness to obey God&#x2019;s emissaries. The scene of their meeting shows a carefully staged setting with Flavian playing the role of the apologetic suppliant (<italic>Hom</italic>. <sc>XXI</sc>: &#x201C;he stood before the Emperor at a distance &#x2013; speechless &#x2013; weeping &#x2013; with downcast eyes &#x2013; covering his face as if he himself had been the doer of all the mischief&#x201D;) trying to inspire pity in the emperor. In spite of Theodosius&#x2019; approachable attitude, his first answer betrayed resentment. At this point, in his second intervention Flavian is invested with such <italic>parrhes&#x00ED;a</italic> in Chrysostom&#x2019;s homily that the bishop&#x2019;s address to Theodosius changed to a patronising tone combined with clear threatening hints. If the emperor finally decided to punish Antioch permanently and ignored the sacred laws, he would become the assistant of the devil, who was the real force behind the Riot.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN190007"><sup>7</sup></xref></p>
<p>These lines show how John Chrysostom intended to instrumentalise Theodosius&#x2019; &#x1F40;&#x03C1;&#x03B3;&#x03AE; with two purposes in mind. First, Chrysostom resorted to the tradition of the <italic>speculum principis</italic> in order to emphasise the control of emotions as <italic>a sine qua non</italic> to be considered a capable Christian emperor.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN190008"><sup>8</sup></xref> Thus, in his <italic>Comparatio Regis et Monachi</italic>, Chrysostom clearly stated that (<italic>Compar</italic>. 2) &#x201C;who truly rules over anger and envy and pleasure (&#x03B8;&#x03C5;&#x00B5;&#x03BF;&#x1FE6; &#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x1F76; &#x03C6;&#x03B8;&#x03CC;&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x03C5; &#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x1F76; &#x1F21;&#x03B4;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;&#x1FC6;&#x03C2; &#x03BA;&#x03C1;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x1FF6;&#x03BD;), who commands all things under the laws of God, who keeps his mind free (&#x2026;) but the one who seems to rule over men, but who is enslaved to anger and to the love of power and pleasures (&#x2026;) will appear quite ridiculous to his subjects.&#x201D;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN190009"><sup>9</sup></xref> Theodosius&#x2019; final pardon in Chrysostom&#x2019;s account (<italic>Hom</italic>. <sc>XXI</sc>) is meant to draw the attention to the emperor&#x2019;s intention to follow the <italic>imitatio Christi</italic> model when it came to overcoming anger and forgiving.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN190010"><sup>10</sup></xref></p>
<p>Second, this standardised portrayal of Theodosius as a good, forgiving, and obedient ruler bestowed by God with imperial power served Chrysostom to accommodate a subtext relating to the schism of Antioch, an internal division that split the Church of Antioch throughout the fourth century. As a result of this, in 387 Antioch had two bishops, Paulinus and Flavian, who performed their ministerial duties in two different places for different congregations. Since Chrysostom belonged to Flavian&#x2019;s group, he used the bishop&#x2019;s embassy to Constantinople as a propagandistic text intended to win leverage for Flavian&#x2019;s party (a successful strategy if we believe texts composed after 387, in which Chrysostom boasts of the converts Flavian made thanks to his intervention on behalf of the city),<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN190011"><sup>11</sup></xref> and to use the image of the emperor as part of the propaganda to support Flavian&#x2019;s group in the context of the Meletian schism by characterising Theodosius as an emperor whose &#x1F40;&#x03C1;&#x03B3;&#x03AE; was placated by Flavian&#x2019;s ethos.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN190012"><sup>12</sup></xref></p>
<p>Although the events of the Riot are mentioned in passing in his work, some excerpts from Ambrose of Milan&#x2019;s writings should be taken into account when exploring the image of Theodosius as an emperor prone to anger. For Ambrose, anger became a sort of necessary evil as it paved the way for the display of imperial <italic>virtutes</italic> such as forgiveness and magnanimity. In the case of Theodosius, Ambrose went as far as to say in the funeral oration on the death of the emperor that Theodosius was especially inclined to forgive (<italic>De obitu Theodosii</italic>, 13) &#x201C;when the passion of his anger had been particularly great.&#x201D;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN190013"><sup>13</sup></xref> In fact, Ambrose added to highlight the quality of Theodosius&#x2019; forgiveness after his anger had been tempered down, &#x201C;one longed for what one dreaded in others, that he should be in a rage. This was a boon to the accused, because while holding supreme power over everyone, he would rather remonstrate like a parent than punish like a judge&#x201D; (<italic>De obitu Theodosii</italic>, 13). This way of portraying Theodosius&#x2019; anger was supported by a Scriptural passage (Psalm 4.4: &#x201C;Be angry and do not sin&#x201D;) that frames the bishop&#x2019;s treatment of anger not only as a way to prevent the emperor from the temptation of retaliation, but also as a form to counter pagan responses to the management of anger by using Scriptural admonitions.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN190014"><sup>14</sup></xref></p>
<p>Ambrose&#x2019;s premise that anger could lead to the demonstration of Christian virtues underlies in his addresses to Theodosius when the emperor experienced a fit of anger in the context of religious conflicts. The bishop encouraged the emperor to follow his own behavior when he forgave Antioch after the Riot of the Statues (<italic>Ep</italic>. 74.32): &#x201C;You have pardoned the people of Antioch for the wrong they have done you.&#x201D; These lines are part of the epilogue of a long letter sent to Theodosius by Ambrose when at Callinicum a synagogue and a building, in which the followers of the Valentinian sect used to meet, were burned down. Ambrose protested at Theodosius&#x2019; first impulse of forcing the local bishop to punish members of his flock and to rebuild the synagogue. First, he resorted to a threatening tone that ran throughout the letter: if the emperor persisted in his idea of assisting the Jewish community, he would be following the example of the much-hated emperor Julian when he tried to rebuild the temple at Jerusalem (<italic>Ep</italic>. 74.12). Theodosius&#x2019; <italic>imitatio Iulianii</italic> would be forcing Ambrose to break the quid pro quo nature of their relationship (<italic>Ep</italic>. 74.1): &#x201C;for if I am unworthy to be heard by you, I am also unworthy to offer sacrifice for you, to be trusted with your vows and your prayers. So will you really not listen to the man whom you would want to be heard praying on your behalf?&#x201D; Second, Ambrose asked Theodosius why he was experiencing that anger (<italic>Ep</italic>. 74.13): &#x201C;if you are moved to anger by the burning of even the most worthless buildings (&#x2026;) do you not remember, emperor, how many mansions of prefects have been burnt at Rome without anyone exacting punishment?&#x201D; With these lines Ambrose implies that the destruction of those buildings at Callinicum did not deserve the anger of the emperor as this emotion should prelude forgiveness, a Christian virtue to which the Jewish community was not entitled (<italic>Ep</italic>. 74.10). Thus, Ambrose showed that he had a clear notion of the hierarchy of powers about which he questioned Theodosius (<italic>Ep</italic>. 74.11): &#x201C;what then is more important, a show of public order, or the cause of religion? Severity ought to give way to devotion.&#x201D;</p>
<p>While Ambrose thought that the anger that Theodosius experienced after the Callinicum episode in 388&#x2013;389 was not justified in Christian terms, in his letter after the riot at Thessalonica the bishop lectured the emperor on how to control and channel his wrath. On this occasion, the emperor had ordered the killing of an important number of Thessalonians when the general Butheric was murdered after the arrest of a popular charioteer. In this context, Ambrose reminded Theodosius, the emperor had surrendered to his worst instincts (<italic>Ep</italic>. 11.4): &#x201C;you have been born with a passionate nature. When there is somebody around to calm you, you quickly channel it into pity, but if somebody inflames it, you let your passion grow to such a pitch that you can scarcely control it.&#x201D; This control could be mastered if Theodosius followed the example of David (<italic>Ep</italic>. 11.7&#x2013;10) and would help him fight his personal devils that were ruining a man (<italic>Ep</italic>. 11.12) &#x201C;who set an unprecedented example of piety, who occupied the summit of clemency, who would not allow individuals to be endangered even if they were guilty.&#x201D; If anger had been improperly experienced by Theodosius in the events at Callinicum, because Jews and heretics did not deserve the virtues that came after anger was assuaged, his wrath after the Thessalonica riot is presented by Ambrose as an opportunity for the emperor to master his emotions and conquer his own devils.</p>
<p>On the pagan side, the sophist Libanius referred to the events of the Riot and their consequences in a number of his works (<italic>Epp</italic>. 154&#x2013;159, <italic>Or</italic>. 32.2), yet it is the set of orations 19&#x2013;23 that dealt directly with it. Composed after the emperor Theodosius had granted the imperial pardon to Antioch, these speeches had four different addresses. From a genre perspective, those dedicated to Caesarius and Hellebichus are <italic>encomia</italic>, while that addressed to the people of Antioch is a <italic>ps&#x00F3;gos</italic> chastising those terrified fellow citizens that had fled. The figure of the emperor Theodosius is comprehensively dealt with in orations 19&#x2013;20. In the <italic>proemium</italic> of the first one, Libanius pretends to have travelled to Constantinople to deliver his oration 19 to placate Theodosius&#x2019; wrath (<italic>Or</italic>. 19.3): &#x201C;So, though my advanced years bid me stay at home, as do many of my friends and relations, who could be heard telling me that it was not safe to plead such a case before an emperor in his wrath, I have deduced from your character and conduct that there will be no untoward consequences for me from my remarks.&#x201D;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN190015"><sup>15</sup></xref> Additionally the sophist follows Menander Rhetor&#x2019;s prescriptions in this oration, who suggests performing this type of speech when a city has fallen into disgrace by amplifying the praises to the emperor recommended in his instructions for the composition of an ambassador&#x2019;s speech (423.7&#x2013;424.2), which was the case for Antioch in 387. As for oration 20, it also shows the sophist&#x2019;s agreement with Menander&#x2019;s suggested topics as Theodosius is represented as a ruler who follows the gods&#x2019; example when it comes to forgiveness,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN190016"><sup>16</sup></xref> an expert and victorious warrior, and the epitome of imperial virtues such as philanthropy, moderation and mildness.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN190017"><sup>17</sup></xref> The insertion of these topics from the <italic>speculum principis</italic> tradition is consistent with the other compositions that Libanius addressed to Theodosius in which appeals to justice, philanthropy and forgiveness are invoked as the key virtues of the figure of the emperor as part of the quid pro quo relationship that they maintained.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN190018"><sup>18</sup></xref> By addressing Theodosius regarding issues that demanded justice and the imperial intervention, Libanius conveyed the image of a combative and quixotic sophist struggling to right wrongs and trying to keep his voice heard when it came to local and imperial affairs. In turn, the emperor secured the support of an eminent pagan by bestowing Libanius with personal favors and some of his attention.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN190019"><sup>19</sup></xref></p>
<p>In the sophist&#x2019;s <italic>Autobiography</italic> we also find a brief but significant reference to the Riot, the content of which conflicts with what is stated in oration 19, as Libanius confesses that he did not leave for Constantinople but remained at Antioch using his influence to help his fellow citizens (<italic>Or</italic>. 1.253): &#x201C;But for this salvation I personally was held responsible. With orations and tears I soothed the members of the newly arrived commission of investigation and began to induce in them an eagerness for petitions, so that in a little while petitions came thick and fast. Let me regard this as the work of Fortune, and also the success of the numerous orations, each with its own variation of style, composed by me on the same theme.&#x201D;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN190020"><sup>20</sup></xref> The <italic>communis opinio</italic> among modern scholars is that Libanius wrote two different versions of his role in the Riot with two different audiences in mind. The fictional journey to Constantinople in <italic>Or</italic>. 19.2&#x2013;4 to deliver his speech in front of Theodosius despite his old age is a rhetorical <italic>topos</italic> designed to imitate John Chrysostom&#x2019;s <italic>ethopoiia</italic> of the bishop Flavian&#x2019;s embassy on behalf of the Antiochenes (<italic>Hom. De St</italic>. <sc>XXI</sc>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN190021"><sup>21</sup></xref> It also helped Libanius to point out that old people like him (he was well into his seventies when the Riot took place) were trying to be pushed out of the spheres of power by a younger generation of officials and bureaucrats.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN190022"><sup>22</sup></xref></p>
<p>Orchestrating two different versions may seem to be the attempt of an aging <italic>pepaideumenos</italic> to retain his influence in Antioch and his share of attention from the emperor Theodosius, but there is much more to it if we read orations 19 and 20 not only as fine examples of rhetorical craftsmanship but also as pieces with important intertextual and metatextual implications that relate to the image of Theodosius in Libanius&#x2019; works. It should be noted that the very first word of his writings on the Riot is the verb &#x1F28;&#x03C4;&#x1F7B;&#x03C7;&#x03B7;&#x03BA;&#x03B5; (<italic>Or</italic>. 19.1), which Norman translated as &#x201C;our city has met with misfortune.&#x201D; Other texts show that Libanius attributed a significant role to <italic>Tyche</italic> in his version of the Riot. In the above-mentioned passage from his <italic>Autobiography</italic>, Libanius tells us that his successful intervention on behalf of Antioch was &#x201C;a work of Fortune&#x201D; (<italic>Or</italic>. 1.253: &#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x1FE6;&#x03C4;&#x03BF; &#x1F14;&#x03C1;&#x03B3;&#x03BF;&#x03BD; &#x1F21;&#x03B3;&#x03BF;&#x03CD;&#x00B5;&#x03B5;&#x03B8;&#x03B1; &#x03C4;&#x1FC6;&#x03C2; &#x03A4;&#x03CD;&#x03C7;&#x03B7;&#x03C2;), and in the <italic>basilikos logos</italic> to thank Theodosius for granting the imperial pardon Libanius sought to excuse Antioch &#x201C;after that disastrous occurrence&#x201D; (<italic>Or</italic>. 20.33: &#x00B5;&#x03B5;&#x03C4;&#x1F70; &#x03C4;&#x1F74;&#x03BD; &#x1F00;&#x03C4;&#x03C5;&#x03C7;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;&#x03BD; &#x1F10;&#x03BA;&#x03B5;&#x1F77;&#x03BD;&#x03B7;&#x03BD;).</p>
<p><italic>Tyche</italic> and its cognates permeated Libanius&#x2019; literary creation of the account of his life and his activities representing the mixture of fortune and luck he had been granted during his life, thus becoming his guardian goddess. Yet the appearance of <italic>Tyche</italic> in Libanius does not point to an apologetic use in religious confrontations (even though <italic>Tyche</italic> had a long presence in Antioch)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN190023"><sup>23</sup></xref> but as a way to shape a religious framework in which the order of things was subject to the will of <italic>Tyche</italic>. In this manner, allusions to <italic>Tyche</italic> in texts about the Riot addressed to Theodosius served not only to excuse Antioch&#x2019;s behavior but especially to create a scenario in which the emperor&#x2019;s decisions had to be taken in a setting dominated by a pagan concept such as <italic>Tyche</italic>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN190024"><sup>24</sup></xref> Implied in this notion is Libanius&#x2019; belief that the welfare of the Empire relied on the appropriate maintenance of the traditional cults,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN190025"><sup>25</sup></xref> a topic developed at length in another speech addressed to Theodosius asking him to enforce existing laws against the destruction of pagan temples (<italic>Pro Templis, Or</italic>. 30). This line of argumentation also features in <italic>Or</italic>. 19.7 when Libanius hinted at the destruction of the temple of Nemesis as a possible cause of the wrongful actions resulting in the Riot that evil spirits encouraged the Antiochenes to do: &#x201C;The present situation surely must be regarded as the responsibility of the same spirit which has gained the aid of an outraged Nemesis also -the outrage being the disappearance of her temple.&#x201D; This reference reinforces Libanius&#x2019; strategy to create a religious context as Nemesis and <italic>Tyche</italic> were two strongly related deities whose agency in the Riot contributed to Libanius&#x2019; plan of constructing a pagan framework in which the emperor&#x2019;s virtues were to be put into practice.</p>
<p>As for the imperial vices, Theodosius&#x2019; anger in Libanius&#x2019; orations is unoriginally presented by resorting to common topics. &#x1F48;&#x03C1;&#x03B3;&#x03AE; is shown as a disease that Antioch momentarily experienced, thus implicitly making Theodosius a doctor under whose responsibility the patient was placed (<italic>Or</italic>. 19.9). &#x1F48;&#x03C1;&#x03B3;&#x03AE; is also taken as a distinctive feature of what differentiated Greeks from barbarians: while the latter despise pity, Greeks are known for their ability to get over &#x1F40;&#x03C1;&#x03B3;&#x03AE; (<italic>Or</italic>. 19.13). These digressions laid the ground for the mention to philanthropy, arguably the most recurrent virtue in late antique imperial speeches.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN190026"><sup>26</sup></xref> Libanius reminded Theodosius that he had already proven himself a philanthropic ruler when he forgave Constantinople for the murder of a Scythian soldier without judgment (<italic>Or</italic>. 19.22, 20.14) and that there were some emperors whose lack of philanthropy he would not want to imitate (<italic>Or</italic>. 19.45). In summary, by overcoming his anger and forgiving Antioch Theodosius had become her new founder (<italic>Or</italic>. 21.41).</p>
<p>Yet in this perfunctory treatment of Theodosius&#x2019; anger Libanius reserved himself a role. First, he portrayed himself as a prophet in his oration 20 when he boasted that he tried to free his fellow citizens from unfounded fears (<italic>Or</italic>. 20.36): &#x201C;Now, indeed, I began to exclaim, &#x2018;The emperor will have such exact knowledge of all this that we, the actual eyewitnesses, could not better him, and he will set the steel to no man&#x2019;s throat.&#x2019;&#x201D; Second, Libanius aimed to exhibit the moral righteousness with which the title of sophist was bestowed by refreshing the emperor&#x2019;s memory about the important role of sophists in the system of communication between emperors and citizens (<italic>Or</italic>. 19.38): &#x201C;Well, consider, Sire, the means by which after this you may have people to praise you. You will, I think, succeed if you regard it as sufficient that none of these malefactors should remain alive. If it were possible for a man to die the death many times over, we ought to have died so.

<p>Moving into fifth century Christian historiography, there is a brief reference to the Riot in Sozomen&#x2019;s <italic>Church History</italic>. The historian echoes Chrysostom&#x2019;s account by narrating Flavian&#x2019;s embassy to Constantinople, but differs from Chrysostom when Sozomen tells us that the bishop realised that persuading Theodosius was such a difficult task that it demanded taking an unorthodox approach. We are told that Flavian (<italic>HE</italic> 7.23) &#x201C;caused some young men accustomed to sing at the table of the emperor to utter these hymns with the litanies of the Antiochans. It is said that the humanity of the emperor was excited; he was overcome by pity at once; his wrath was subdued, and as his heart yearned over the city, he shed tears on the cup which he held in his hand.&#x201D; This strategy was successful in making Theodosius abandon his wrath. &#x201C;Much bloodshed would have ensued,&#x201D; Sozomen concluded, &#x201C;had not the wrath of the emperor been stayed by his respect for this sacerdotal entreaty.&#x201D;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN190028"><sup>28</sup></xref></p>
<p>The main differences between Sozomen&#x2019;s and Chrysostom&#x2019;s portrayal of Theodosius lie in the emperor&#x2019;s <italic>ethopoiia</italic>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN190029"><sup>29</sup></xref> Chrysostom&#x2019;s Theodosius was given the chance to reply when addressed by the bishop Flavian, but in Sozomen&#x2019;s episode the emperor suddenly changed his mind having been moved after hearing the young men singing at the table. This was not an uncommon practice in the Christian milieu. It was encouraged by Clement of Alexandria in the prescriptions included in his <italic>Pedagogue</italic> (<sc>II</sc>.43&#x2013;44)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN190030"><sup>30</sup></xref> on how to behave in a Christian fashion when attending banquets, and by John Chrysostom in his apotropaic recommendation on how to bring God to the table and expel the evilness involved in uncontrollable laughter, drunkenness, and gluttony (<italic>Expos. in Psalm</italic> 41, PG 55.157.35&#x2013;45). To the emperor&#x2019;s swift change of disposition in Sozomen&#x2019;s passage the use of passive forms is fundamental in explaining Theodosius&#x2019; obedient attitude. Once his impulse to destroy the city (&#x03B4;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;&#x03C6;&#x03B8;&#x03B5;&#x1FD6;&#x03C1;&#x03B1;&#x03B9; &#x03B4;&#x03B9;&#x03B5;&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x03B5;&#x1FD6;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;) was suppressed, Theodosius surrendered to a submissive disposition in which philanthropy and pity overcame him (&#x03C6;&#x03B9;&#x03BB;&#x03B1;&#x03BD;&#x03B8;&#x03C1;&#x03C9;&#x03C0;&#x03AF;&#x1FB3; &#x03B4;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;&#x03C7;&#x03B5;&#x03B8;&#x03AD;&#x03BD;&#x03C4;&#x03B1; &#x03C4;&#x1F78;&#x03BD; &#x03B2;&#x03B1;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03BB;&#x03AD;&#x03B1; &#x03BA;&#x03C1;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03B7;&#x03B8;&#x1FC6;&#x03BD;&#x03B1;&#x03B9; &#x03C4;&#x1FF7; &#x1F10;&#x03BB;&#x03AD;&#x1FF3;).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN190031"><sup>31</sup></xref> Under the influence of these two Christianised virtues -philanthropy and pity-, Theodosius became an emperor capable of stopping his anger (&#x03C4;&#x1F74;&#x03BD; &#x1F40;&#x03C1;&#x03B3;&#x1F74;&#x03BD; &#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03AD;&#x03C0;&#x03B1;&#x03C5;&#x03C3;&#x03B5;&#x03BD;) thanks to the respect inspired by Flavian&#x2019;s suplication (&#x03C4;&#x1F74;&#x03BD; &#x1F31;&#x03B5;&#x03C1;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x1F74;&#x03BD; &#x1F51;&#x03C0;&#x1F78; &#x03B5;&#x1F50;&#x03C3;&#x03B5;&#x03B2;&#x03B5;&#x03AF;&#x03B1;&#x03C2; &#x1F31;&#x03BA;&#x03B5;&#x03C3;&#x03AF;&#x03B1;&#x03BD; &#x03B1;&#x1F30;&#x03B4;&#x03B5;&#x03C3;&#x03B8;&#x03B5;&#x03AF;&#x03C2;).</p>
<p>Three unexpected actors (Flaccilla, Ambrose of Milan, and the monk Macedonius) come to the fore in the version of the Riot in Theodoret of Cyrus&#x2019; <italic>Ecclesiastical History</italic>. First, Theodoret places his telling of the Riot after a short praise of Theodosius&#x2019; wife, Flaccilla, who was adorned with some of the virtues that a fourth century Christian empress could have (<italic>HE</italic> 5.19): being a good counselor to her husband, and generous with the sick and underprivileged. She passed away in 386, one year before her statue &#x2013; alongside the representations of the imperial family- was torn down and dragged through Antioch during the Riot.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN190032"><sup>32</sup></xref> According to Theodoret, it was the desecration of her statue that enraged Theodosius, whose &#x03C6;&#x03B9;&#x03BB;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03C1;&#x03B3;&#x03AF;&#x03B1; for Flaccilla is underlined in the text as one of the reasons that made him take serious measures to chastise Antioch, which would have been carried out had Ambrose of Milan not intervened, the second important character in Theodoret&#x2019;s version. The bishop of Milan is given a prominent role in the aftermath of the Riot thanks to a chronological <italic>lapsus</italic> since Theodoret set the Riot of the Statues after the Massacre of Thessalonica (<sc>V</sc>.17&#x2013;18), a revolt that Theodosius solved by ordering the killing of several thousands in 390.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN190033"><sup>33</sup></xref> Scholars agree that this is not an innocent historical lapsus, but a conscious manipulation on Theodoret&#x2019;s side in order to show how the emperor&#x2019;s &#x03B5;&#x1F50;&#x03C3;&#x03AD;&#x03B2;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03B1; (a concept that Theodoret considered to be akin to religious orthodoxy)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN190034"><sup>34</sup></xref> evolved thanks to the firm hand of the bishop of Milan, who resorted to a law (<italic>Cod. Theod.</italic> 9, 40, 13) issued apropos the killing of Thessalonica in order to properly manage executions in cases of capital punishment.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN190035"><sup>35</sup></xref> The third relevant character in Theodoret&#x2019;s passage is Macedonius, one of the monks who had come down from the surrounding mountains to plead to the imperial emissaries.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN190036"><sup>36</sup></xref> Although illiterate and ignorant of the Scriptures, Macedonius gave a brief speech to Hellebichus and Caesarius asking them to remind the emperor that &#x201C;the nature of man is formed after the image and likeness of God&#x201D; (a famous quote from Genesis 1:26).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN190037"><sup>37</sup></xref> This intervention would be, according to the French editors of Theodoret,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN190038"><sup>38</sup></xref> a device to further Theodoret&#x2019;s strategy of presenting Theodosius as an obedient emperor who learned to control his rage and the consequences of his decisions by respecting the ecclesiastical hierarchy (attention had to be paid heeding first to bishops and then to monks), as proven by Theodoret&#x2019;s final remark: &#x201C;In relating these events I have had a twofold object. I did not think it right to leave in oblivion the boldness of the illustrious monk, and I wished to point out the advantage of the edict which was put out by the advice of the great Ambrosius.&#x201D;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN190039"><sup>39</sup></xref></p>
<p>At the beginning of the sixth century the pagan historian Zosimus composed his <italic>New History</italic> to prove that the barbarisation of the Empire, together with the abandonment of traditional values and religious cults for a new Christian order, were to be accounted as the main reasons for the disappearance of the Roman Empire.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN190040"><sup>40</sup></xref> In this context, Zosimus held Theodosius to be an incompetent emperor, one of those responsible for hammering the final nail into the coffin of late paganism.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN190041"><sup>41</sup></xref> In the historian&#x2019;s eyes (4.41), the Riot of the Statues reflected a period when corruption, luxury, and intemperance prevailed. The destruction of the statues of Theodosius and his wife was considered by Zosimus to be a shameful act (&#x03B1;&#x1F30;&#x03C3;&#x03C7;&#x03C1;&#x1FF6;&#x03C2;) that he downplayed by remarking that tumult and insults were characteristic of Antioch&#x2019;s idiosyncratic sense of humour. At this point, Zosimus resumes Libanius&#x2019; version of his fictional embassy to Constantinople yet he adds a companion, Hilarius, a member of the Antiochene curia who would have also gone to Constantinople where Theodosius&#x2019; wrath was appeased by Libanius&#x2019; speech. In fact, Zosimus continues, their embassy was so successful that Theodosius rewarded Libanius by commissioning him with the composition of a second speech (Libanius&#x2019; <italic>Or</italic>. 20 <italic>To the Emperor Theodosius, after the Reconciliation</italic>), and Hilarius by appointing him governor of Palestine.</p>
<p>Zosimus&#x2019; biased approach to the events of the Riot underlined the pagan cultural pedigree of the embassy that persuaded Theodosius to forgive Antioch. Libanius had a well-established reputation in the cultural milieu, so it comes as no surprise that Zosimus mentioned the sophist&#x2019;s &#x03BA;&#x03BB;&#x03AD;&#x03BF;&#x03C2; (glory, fame) as the reason why he was chosen for the embassy. As for Hilarius, he is absent from the rest of the accounts on the Riot but has been identified by F. Paschoud as Hilarius 8 in the <italic>PLRE</italic>, proconsul in Palestine in 392&#x2013;393.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN190042"><sup>42</sup></xref> In fact, the <italic>PLRE</italic> gives credibility to Zosimus&#x2019; text as Hilarius &#x201C;owed his governorship to the impression he made then.&#x201D; He was also a student of Libanius, who praised him in several letters for being a well-learned <italic>pepaideumenos</italic> with an ability to translate from Latin into Greek (<italic>Ep</italic>. 181N; 185N). These facts would explain Zosimus&#x2019; words praising his family and education (4.41: &#x03B3;&#x03AD;&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x03C5;&#x03C2; &#x03C4;&#x03B5; &#x03BB;&#x03B1;&#x00B5;&#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x03CC;&#x03C4;&#x03B7;&#x03C4;&#x03B9; &#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x1F76; &#x03C0;&#x03B1;&#x03BD;&#x03C4;&#x1F76; &#x03C0;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;&#x03B4;&#x03B5;&#x03AF;&#x03B1;&#x03C2; &#x03B5;&#x1F34;&#x03B4;&#x03B5;&#x03B9; &#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03AE;&#x03BA;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;).</p>
<p>It should also be questioned why Zosimus adopted Libanius&#x2019; version of his fictitious journey to Constantinople instead of following the text in which the sophist acknowledged that he remained at Antioch after the Riot. According to F. Paschoud and R. Goulet, the fourth book of Zosimus&#x2019; <italic>New History</italic> relies entirely on Eunapius&#x2019; <italic>History</italic>, who in turn knew Libanius&#x2019; <italic>Autobiography</italic>, a text that had enjoyed a wide and fast circulation by the end of the fourth century.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN190043"><sup>43</sup></xref> The presence of two pagan characters &#x2013; Libanius, for whom he had mixed feelings, and Hilarius &#x2013; together with the absence of mentions of Christians in the aftermath of the Riot would fit with Eunapius&#x2019; historiographical programme designed to try to counter the emergence and power of Christianity. I think, then, that it is fair to speculate that Eunapius knew the two different versions of Libanius yet preferred to follow Libanius&#x2019; account of his fictitious embassy in <italic>Or</italic>. 19. This was a choice that eventually both inspired and misled the unreliable Zosimus, who passed this incident down without reexamining the sources because of his blind loyalty towards Eunapius, especially when chastising the Christian Theodosius was at stake.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN190044"><sup>44</sup></xref></p>
<p>The religious implications of Zosimus&#x2019; inaccurate version of the Riot of the Statues become more evident when it is compared with the narration of a similar episode concerning Antioch and another imperial figure. Zosimus tells us (3.11) that when the emperor Julian arrived at Antioch in 362 two different conceptions of life collided: Julian&#x2019;s <italic>bios philosophikos</italic> was poles apart from the happy-go-lucky attitude of the Antiochenes. Other factors complicated Julian&#x2019;s experience in Antioch: the long-standing and strong presence of Christianity in the city, the emperor&#x2019;s religious programme, and Julian&#x2019;s failed policy to regulate the price of grain during his stay there. In this context, the Antiochenes gave free rein to jokes and mockery regarding the emperor&#x2019;s lifestyle and physical appearance, to which Julian replied by composing his bitter and witty <italic>Misopogon</italic>. In his work, Zosimus does not deny this strife but does his best to smooth the incident out as an amusing anecdote intended to show Julian&#x2019;s skills as a caricaturist. If we compare Theodosius&#x2019; and Julian&#x2019;s conflicts with Antioch, Zosimus&#x2019; partial attitude becomes apparent. First, it should be appreciated that the atmosphere that propitiated the Riot was described by Zosimus as corrupted (&#x03A4;&#x1FF6;&#x03BD; &#x03B4;&#x1F72; &#x1F51;&#x03C0;&#x1F78; &#x03C4;&#x1F74;&#x03BD; &#x0398;&#x03B5;&#x03BF;&#x03B4;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x03AF;&#x03BF;&#x03C5; &#x03B2;&#x03B1;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03BB;&#x03B5;&#x03AF;&#x03B1;&#x03BD; &#x03BF;&#x1F55;&#x03C4;&#x03C9; &#x03B4;&#x03B9;&#x03B5;&#x03C6;&#x03B8;&#x03B1;&#x03C1;&#x00B5;&#x03AD;&#x03BD;&#x03C9;&#x03BD;) as well as symptomatic of a period of moral decay. In contrast, the arrival of Julian&#x2019;s army to Antioch is portrayed as a gentle and serene journey (&#x039C;&#x03B5;&#x03B8;&#x2019; &#x1F45;&#x03C3;&#x03B7;&#x03C2; &#x00B5;&#x1F72;&#x03BD; &#x03BF;&#x1F56;&#x03BD; &#x1F21;&#x03C3;&#x03C5;&#x03C7;&#x03AF;&#x03B1;&#x03C2; &#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x1F76; &#x03B5;&#x1F50;&#x03BB;&#x03B1;&#x03B2;&#x03B5;&#x03AF;&#x03B1;&#x03C2;) to a city that welcomed him with a kind disposition (&#x03C6;&#x03B9;&#x03BB;&#x03BF;&#x03C6;&#x03C1;&#x03CC;&#x03BD;&#x03C9;&#x03C2;). Second, the Antiochenes&#x2019; unpleasant expressions against Theodosius and his family are excused by Zosimus because of the tension of the situation and because of the reputation of Antioch&#x2019;s wits (&#x03C4;&#x1FC6;&#x03C2; &#x03C3;&#x03C5;&#x03BD;&#x03AE;&#x03B8;&#x03BF;&#x03C5;&#x03C2; &#x03B1;&#x1F50;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x1FD6;&#x03C2; &#x1F00;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03CC;&#x03C4;&#x03B7;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;). However, similar witticisms are deemed serious offenses when the Antiochenes teased Julian for his reluctance to attend or enjoy theatrical spectacles (&#x03B5;&#x1F34;&#x03C1;&#x03B3;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;&#x03C4;&#x03CC;&#x03C2; &#x03C4;&#x03B5; &#x03B8;&#x03B5;&#x03AC;&#x03C4;&#x03C1;&#x03C9;&#x03BD; &#x1F11;&#x03B1;&#x03C5;&#x03C4;&#x03CC;&#x03BD;). Third, Theodosius needed to be persuaded by two pagan figures (Libanius and Hilarius) to cancel his punishments against Antioch. In the case of Julian, he took care of his discord with the Antiochenes by composing the <italic>Misopogon</italic>,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN190045"><sup>45</sup></xref> described by Zosimus as a refined and charming (&#x03BB;&#x03CC;&#x03B3;&#x03BF;&#x03BD; &#x03B4;&#x1F72; &#x1F00;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03CC;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;) work that made the people of Antioch feel sorry for their jokes. Unlike Theodosius, Julian appears as a firm and persuasive ruler willing to use dialogue to air any grievances. Consequently, as noted by Paschoud, these two episodes were manipulated by Zosimus in his attempt to follow Eunapius&#x2019; religious agenda by presenting a pro-Julianic tale of Julian&#x2019;s dealings with the Antiochenes that contrasts with Theodosius&#x2019; management of the crisis in 387.</p>
<p>By contrast to other texts such as Themistius&#x2019; <italic>To Theodosius on the most royal virtues</italic>, which take a more theoretical approach to the image of an emperor, the analysis of the sources regarding the Riot of the Statues allows us to explore how the articulation of Theodosius&#x2019; virtues (pity, clemency, <italic>philanthropia</italic> were the common stock of virtues that were emphasised regardless of the religious affiliation of the authors) as the result of the appeasement of anger were merged into the authors&#x2019; personal agendas.</p>
<p>In the Christian sources, Theodosius features as a figure who always ends up persuaded by Christian methods, with the intention of reasserting the new order in which Christian figures such as bishops and monks not only had the moral upper hand, but also symbolised the supremacy of heavenly matters over earthly powers. As Ambrose wrote to Theodosius in a threatening way (<italic>Ep.</italic> 74.33), <italic>ut me magis audires in regia, ne si necesse esset audires in ecclesia</italic>. The pagan sources put the emphasis on the context in which the Riot took place. Libanius&#x2019; orations 19&#x2013;20, together with other pieces meant to reach Theodosius, were intended to be a polite reminder of the necessity of enforcing existing laws that protected traditional cults.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN190046"><sup>46</sup></xref> In this way, the image of Theodosius as a forgiving and philanthropic ruler in the set of speeches on the Riot is framed in a pagan context in which two important concepts &#x2013; Tyche and Nemesis &#x2013; dominated the scene. In the case of Zosimus, the Riot was deployed as a rhetorical exemplum of the decadence of the Empire under Christian emperors. In both cases, it is evident that pagan and Christian sources did not hesitate to instrumentalise Theodosius&#x2019; image for their own purposes.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN190047"><sup>47</sup></xref></p>
<p>Leaving aside the differences among the sources regarding who should be credited with the merit of having eased the emperor Theodosius and what political issues underlaid during the Riot, both pagan and Christian authors coincide in focusing their narratives on the anger of the emperor Theodosius. Approaches to his wrath vary in their treatment of this emotion but seem to follow a similar pattern: the emperor&#x2019;s &#x1F40;&#x03C1;&#x03B3;&#x03AE;, which was unanimously excused given the magnitude of the affront, gave way to a display of imperial virtues. The angry response of the emperor Theodosius to riotous events as shown in the sources was framed within two discourses that converged into the same narrative: the transformation of his &#x1F40;&#x03C1;&#x03B3;&#x03AE; into the display of imperial virtues. Thus, when Christian and pagan sources are compared, a stronger emphasis in accommodating Theodosius&#x2019; reactions to a literary tradition (mainly, the <italic>speculum principis</italic> and Menander Rhetor&#x2019;s <italic>basilikos logos</italic>) is appreciated in Libanius&#x2019; and Zosimus&#x2019; accounts of the Riot of the Statues. However, in the case of Ambrose of Milan and John Chrysostom, the emperor&#x2019;s anger is contextualised within a Christian set of values in which &#x1F40;&#x03C1;&#x03B3;&#x03AE; had become a desirable emotional state if it led to the implementation of Christian virtues such as repentance and forgiveness.</p></body>

<p>His epistolographic corpus shows that he composed almost 300 letters in his last years although he failed to expand his network among the new and influential political elite Watts (2015: 193&#x2013;211). Libanius wanted to draw attention not to his actual response after the Riot, but aimed to construct a &#x201C;performable ethos&#x201D; (Fredal 2001: 256&#x2013;257; Nesselrath and Van Hoof 2014: 160&#x2013;161) still active and competitive with other public figures (in this case, the bishop Flavian). On the other hand, the passage from his <italic>Autobiography</italic> (<italic>Or</italic>. 1.254) in which he underlines his efforts to persuade the imperial commissioners in Antioch was composed with the intention of strengthening his position as an active pagan spokesman in a group of speeches that could have reached Theodosius as some of his pieces had before.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Modern historical analyses of the era of the Theodosian dynasty (379&#x2013;455) tend to focus on the actions of the individual emperors, the proclamation of Christianity as state religion, the so-called separation of East and West in 395 and its consequences, the role of imperial women, or the invasions of non-Roman peoples.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200001"><sup>1</sup></xref> This contribution deals with an aspect that so far has not received much scholarly attention: the operations of the administrative structures at the end of the fourth century, with a particular focus on Theodosius&#x2019; role in developments of the administration. While scholars generally agree that the new complex administrative system of provinces, dioceses, and prefectures was fully operational by the end of the fourth century, not much research has been done on the effect of specific late fourth century political developments of the empire on the administrative structures.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200002"><sup>2</sup></xref> In part, this has to do with the way in which scholarship of the (Late) Roman world tends to analyze: studies concentrate either on emperors and their highest political officials such as the urban and praetorian prefects within the framework of imperial politics and representations of power, or they focus on the local functioning of provincial government. Consequently, one gets the impression that these were two different levels of management that never really intermingled. In other words, this often leads to studies of individual emperors without examining the daily operations of the administrative structures, even though these were crucial for the stability and consolidation of imperial rule. As a result, apart from discussing the far-reaching changes under Diocletian and Constantine in the early fourth century, scholars do not often discuss the performance of subsequent individual emperors in combination with the practical operations of the imperial administration. To a certain extent, one might argue that the short-term rule and even personality of an individual emperor mattered less for the long-term effective organisation and operations of the administration. Nevertheless, it might be worthwhile to examine them in connection to each other.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200003"><sup>3</sup></xref></p>
<p>This contribution presents an analysis that aims to integrate the engagement of the individual emperor Theodosius the Great (379&#x2013;395) with the functioning of the administrative structures of the empire at large. After a brief discussion of the geographical and administrative structures of the empire in the 370s preceding Theodosius&#x2019; accession to the throne, the emperor&#x2019;s involvement with his administration will be illustrated by considering his dealings particularly with the prefectures and dioceses as well as his appointment policies and legislation. It will become clear that, while Theodosius was confronted with exceptional conditions in that both internal and external enemies threatened the stability of the empire and in particular of the imperial position, he also tried to maintain and be involved in the regular daily business of the empire&#x2019;s administration. Even though parts of the empire might have been in turmoil which called for the emperor&#x2019;s special attention, others parts were secure but of course still in need of an emperor who represented stable imperial leadership and was accessible to them for their requests. The results of this contribution will attempt to advance our understanding of the close connection between individual emperors, administrative structures and empire wide developments in the late fourth century.</p>

<title>The Geographical and Administrative Structures of the Empire in the 370s</title>
<p>The emperors Diocletian (284&#x2013;305) and Constantine the Great (306&#x2013;337) set in motion a series of reforms that resulted in a more complex, hierarchical and multi-layered system of administrative units, i.e. provinces, dioceses, and prefectures, as well as in a considerable increase in the number of officials administering these different types of units.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200004"><sup>4</sup></xref> Considering the complexity of the new organisation of provincial government, our evidence shows that it took years, if not decades, for all these new units to be implemented at an empire wide level.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200005"><sup>5</sup></xref> Regional differences may have played a part too in the pace of the actual realisation of the alterations in certain areas of the empire. Notably, we are almost completely left in the dark about the decision making process behind this large scale administrative operation, as well as about the way the inhabitants of the empire &#x2018;experienced&#x2019; the increasingly complex system.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200006"><sup>6</sup></xref></p>
<p>Remarkably few ancient sources have documented these far-reaching administrative changes. Our most important sources are the Verona List (<italic>Laterculus Veronensis</italic>) of the early fourth century, and the <italic>Notitia Dignitatum</italic>, with its eastern and western lists, each with their own date of creation, but roughly speaking reflecting the empire&#x2019;s situation in the late fourth and early fifth centuries.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200007"><sup>7</sup></xref> At first sight, these bare administrative lists seem to reveal little information, except for acknowledging territorial boundaries, as the lists indicate which provinces were part of which diocese. However, a comparison between the Verona List and the two <italic>Notitiae</italic> indicates that three major changes were made in the names and territories of the dioceses over the course of the fourth century: (1) Aegyptus became an independent diocese instead of being part of the diocese of Oriens; (2) Moesia was split into the dioceses of Dacia and Macedonia; (3) and the dioceses of Galliae and Viennensis ended up as one diocese, i.e. Septem Provinciae.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200008"><sup>8</sup></xref> Each of these changes in the dioceses were the result of specific regional and/or empire wide political conditions. Notably, all three adjustments to the dioceses can be dated to the reign of Theodosius <sc>I</sc>. Ultimately, by the end of the fourth century, there were 116 provinces divided over thirteen dioceses, six in the West (Britannia, Septem Provinciae, Hispania, Africa, Italia, and Illyricum) and seven in the East (Dacia, Macedonia, Thracia, Asiana,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200009"><sup>9</sup></xref> Pontica, Oriens, and Aegyptus).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200010"><sup>10</sup></xref> The dioceses in turn were grouped together in four prefectures, i.e. Galliarum, Italia, Illyricum and Oriens.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200011"><sup>11</sup></xref></p>

<title>The Accession of Theodosius <sc>I</sc></title>
<p>In the early 370s, the empire was ruled by two emperors, Valentinian <sc>I</sc> (364&#x2013;375) in the West, and his brother Valens (364&#x2013;378) in the East. When Valentinian <sc>I</sc> died in 375, his son Gratian, who had been appointed by his father as junior co-ruler in 367, became the senior emperor for the West, joining his rule with his brother Valentinian <sc>II</sc> as his junior emperor as the latter had been acclaimed emperor by the armed forces. While Valens died at the battle of Adrianople in 378, and Gratian was murdered in 383, Valentinian <sc>II</sc> remained on the western throne until 392.</p>
<p>After the devastating loss of Valens at Adrianople in 378, Valentinian and Gratian&#x2019;s rule over the western half of the empire was temporarily expanded to the east as well. In order to stabilise the situation in Illyricum and the East, they asked Theodosius for help. Although Theodosius was not a relative of the emperors, he had experience within the imperial administration as he had been <italic>dux</italic> in Moesia around 374.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200012"><sup>12</sup></xref> By the mid to late 370s, Theodosius had retreated to his estates in Gallaecia in Spain, perhaps because he had fallen out of favour. Now, by the late 370s, the imperial government was in need of strong and capable officials. The emperors called upon Theodosius to resume a military command against the Goths, thereby allowing him to return into a powerful position which eventually led to obtaining the imperial position in 379.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200013"><sup>13</sup></xref> As Leppin has argued, however, Theodosius might have been already asked to come back from Spain by Gratian before the battle at Adrianople in early August, as the time frame between Valens&#x2019; death and Theodosius officially assuming the emperorship over the East in January of 379 seems quite short for the steep promotion that he then subsequently made.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200014"><sup>14</sup></xref></p>
<p>When new emperors came to the throne, and Theodosius would not have been an exception, it was of the utmost importance to position themselves firmly within their imperial administration. The following analysis, based on the empire&#x2019;s administrative and geographical division into prefectures, dioceses and provinces, offers us insights into Theodosius&#x2019; engagement in the daily affairs of the imperial administration.</p>

<title>Theodosius and the Prefectures</title>
<p>First, the geographical division of the empire&#x2019;s prefectures, i.e. the largest units within the administration, had to be clarified by Theodosius as the previous two decades, starting in the 360s, had shown various (and sometimes temporary) adjustments to the geography of the administration in reaction to the political situation in the empire. The period between the death of Constantine the Great in 337 and the early 360s had been a formative phase in the development of the prefectures. Whereas originally praetorian prefects can been seen as &#x2013; what Barnes called &#x2013; &#x2018;old style prefects&#x2019; and thus the highest officials of the empire who accompanied emperors wherever the latter would go, in the decades post-337 the praetorian prefecture evolved into a command that was attached to a specific region.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200015"><sup>15</sup></xref> During these decades, both old and new style prefects appear until the mid-360s when most praetorian prefects seem to be responsible for and attached to the administration of certain regions of the empire.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200016"><sup>16</sup></xref> By then, there were alternating three or four prefectures: Gaul, Oriens, Italy with Africa and sometimes with or without Illyricum. The evidence for the individual praetorian prefects points to certain moments in the mid-to-late fourth century during which Italy, Africa and Illyricum were joined into one prefecture, while at other moments Illyricum was a separate prefecture.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200017"><sup>17</sup></xref> The career of Claudius Mamertinus is illustrative for this shift back and forth.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200018"><sup>18</sup></xref> In 361, during the reign of the emperor Julian (361&#x2013;363), Mamertinus was appointed Praetorian Prefect of Illyricum, presumably by the emperor himself.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200019"><sup>19</sup></xref> Soon, in early 362, he seems to have become Praetorian Prefect of Italy and Africa as well, as might be concluded from a series of laws from the <italic>Codex Theodosianus</italic>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200020"><sup>20</sup></xref> For whatever reason, in mid-364 the prefecture seems to have been divided into two, as Sextus Claudius Petronius Probus was serving as Praetorian Prefect of Illyricum alone and thus leaving Africa and Italy to Mamertinus.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200021"><sup>21</sup></xref> This turned out to be a temporary situation, because by late 364 Mamertinus was Praetorian Prefect of Italy, Africa and Illyricum again which then seems to have lasted through 365.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200022"><sup>22</sup></xref></p>
<p>By 364, when the empire was in the hands of the two emperors Valentinian <sc>I</sc> (364&#x2013;375) and Valens (364&#x2013;378), both rulers met in Naissus and in Sirmium, so Ammianus Marcellinus tells us, to discuss some sort of geographical division of rule, agreeing upon a regional division of responsibilities, of administrative staff and army units.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200023"><sup>23</sup></xref> For modern scholars this meeting could be explained as one of the clear forerunners of the split between East and West, which we tend to perceive in a more definite version upon the death of Theodosius <sc>I</sc> in 395. However, in recent years modern scholarship has questioned the almost &#x2018;traditional&#x2019; split of the Empire into East and West in the year 395 and has called for a sense of more unity of the empire.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200024"><sup>24</sup></xref> If one accepts this reassessment, then we should also rethink the implication of the empire&#x2019;s separation as a result of the meeting of Valentinian and Valens.</p>
<p>In regard to the emperors&#x2019; deliberations about the prefectures, Valentinian I opted for a conservative continuation of the status quo of the three prefectures, even though in our eyes the geographical structure of three prefectures seems impracticable to control, if not untenable. It might seem more sensible to separate the prefecture of Italia, Africa, and Illyricum into at least two prefectures. Nevertheless, this situation of three prefectures lasted for another decade until the year 376 when serious problems with the Goths &#x2013; their settlement in Thrace threatened to turn into war &#x2013; led to a temporary separation of Illyricum from Italia and Africa.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200025"><sup>25</sup></xref> Julius Ausonius was appointed Praetorian Prefect of Illyricum and in office late in the year 377, although we lack any further information about his accomplishments during the term of office.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200026"><sup>26</sup></xref> In an attempt to regain civil control over Illyricum, Gratian, in early 378, appointed Quintus Clodius Hermogianus Olybrius as Praetorian Prefect, an experienced official who had held several governorships as well as the urban prefecture of Rome.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200027"><sup>27</sup></xref> Of course, the emperors would send their military commanders to the region as well to deal with the military threat posed by the Goths. In such situations of danger and potential instability in parts of the empire, it remains difficult for us to get a sense of how the civil administration of governors, <italic>vicarii</italic>, and praetorian prefects continued in these regions. Did it come to a halt until stability was guaranteed again, or would it be able to remain in place and function properly? In most cases, we simply lack the evidence to be able to say anything about the administrative state of affairs.</p>
<p>This particular situation in Thrace soon led to a military crisis resulting in the battle of Adrianople on August 9, 378, and in the subsequent death of the emperor Valens. Ammianus tells us that Valens, who had decided not to wait for Gratian, left the city of Adrianople for the battle field together with his military commanders, while the imperial signia, the praetorian prefect and his advisory council were left behind within the city walls and protected by a proper guard.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200028"><sup>28</sup></xref> In other words, even though his name is not specified, most likely Olybrius was the praetorian prefect who stayed behind in Adrianople and who thus evaded the battle. Of course, Olybrius was no military official, and by leaving him behind in the city with the imperial insignia, Valens made sure that the highest civil official would stay alive in case something would happen to the emperor himself. After Valens&#x2019; death, Gratian continued to have confidence in Olybrius, and somewhere between late 378 and before the appointment of Theodosius as emperor in January 379 he seems to have transferred Olybrius to the appointment of Praetorian Prefect Orientis. As for the other Praetorian Prefects of the empire, after the battle at Adrianople, Gratian seems to have promoted the two Praetorian Prefects of Galliarum, Decimius Magnus Ausonius and his son Decimius Hilarianus Hesperius into a joint Praetorian Prefecture (<italic>praefectura duplex</italic>) over Gaul, Italy, and Africa.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200029"><sup>29</sup></xref> Apparently, he trusted these men to the extent that he left them with the highest civil authority of almost the entire western half of the empire.</p>
<p>On January 19 of 379, Theodosius was appointed emperor and seems to have accepted the responsibility over Illyricum until the situation with the Goths was settled.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200030"><sup>30</sup></xref> He decided to stay in Illyricum and took up residence in Thessalonica. While Sirmium had been the administrative center of Illyricum, in the previous decades it had suffered from invasions of non-Roman peoples and had become vulnerable.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200031"><sup>31</sup></xref> So Theodosius opted for Thessalonica, which was better protected, to become the center of imperial presence, if only for a few years in the late 370s and early 380s, until the wars were over and Theodosius moved to Constantinople where an <italic>adventus</italic> was held for him on 24 November 380.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200032"><sup>32</sup></xref></p>
<p>As to what happened to the civil administration of Illyricum in the aftermath of the battle at Adrianople, the evidence is unclear. In times of potential threats to the stability of the region and the empire at large, such as during the problems with the Goths, it was more practical to have a separate praetorian prefect for Illyricum. Theodosius appears not to have appointed a Praetorian Prefect of Illyricum immediately, but he seems to have taken his time in search for a reliable candidate for the position in a region that had proven to be vulnerable as well as important in connecting the eastern and western half of the empire. Of course, Theodosius&#x2019; own presence in the region might have made the time frame for the appointment less urgent.</p>
<p>By the following year 380, Theodosius had found a candidate in Eutropius who remained in office through September 381.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200033"><sup>33</sup></xref> For part of the first year of his appointment Theodosius and Eutropius were probably both stationed in Thessalonica. Although a native from Bordeaux, Eutropius had spent much time in the East, he had accompanied Julian on his campaign against the Persians, had been the <italic>magister memoriae</italic> in the East under Valens, and had then become proconsul of Asia in 371/2. Eutropius&#x2019; prefecture of Illyricum would have contained the dioceses of Macedonia, Dacia, and Thracia.</p>
<p>During Eutropius&#x2019; term of office as Praetorian Prefect of Illyricum he received many laws from the emperors which offer an insight into the issues that were dealt with by the imperial government. Notably, these laws give no indication of a dire situation in the prefecture, but seem to deal with matters that were part of the daily affairs of life throughout the Roman Empire.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200034"><sup>34</sup></xref> For instance, there is a series of laws addressed to Eutropius, issued in Thessalonica on 17 June 380 and in the name of Gratian, Valentinian <sc>II</sc>, and Theodosius. As this series was issued in Thessalonica, we can assume that Theodosius was the instigator. These laws are concerned for instance with betrothal and antenuptial gifts, payment of trials, rejection of criminals in offices in the provinces, or property laws for the family of those who were deported.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200035"><sup>35</sup></xref> In other words, while Theodosius on the one hand tried to get a military grip on the situation with the Goths, on the other hand he also made an attempt to continue regular administrative business. The latter would have been expected from an emperor, even if he were away from the imperial capital. We have to keep in mind that the empire was hardly ever at war in its entirety. Thus, war and instability in one region of the empire would be of little to no concern in the secure and prosperous regions of the empire which would, however, expect the emperor to be available as their ruler as well. Indeed, while in Thesssalonica, Theodosius would have been accompanied by a large group of imperial officials responsible for the various bureaus that ran the empire&#x2019;s administration. Wherever the emperor would be, he was expected to be accessible for petitions of his subjects as well as the issuing of issuing imperial legislation. The continuation &#x2013; or perhaps the revival &#x2013; of the daily administration in the region can also be seen as a signal to the local population in the provinces that the imperial government was in control of its empire. Once the Gothic wars were over in 382, Theodosius returned Illyricum back into &#x2018;western&#x2019; control as he had promised to Gratian.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200036"><sup>36</sup></xref></p>
<p>In the following year, Sextus Claudius Petronius Probus was Praetorian Prefect of Italy, Africa, and Illyricum, so at first sight the former construction of a large central prefecture within the empire seems to have been restored. However, Probus&#x2019; term might have lasted only a few months and it is not quite clear if Illyricum continued to be part of this central prefecture.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200037"><sup>37</sup></xref> The ancient evidence for most of the succeeding Praetorian Prefects mentions Italy and Africa as their geographical responsibility, but not Illyricum until the prefecture of Flavius Eusignius in 386 who appears to have been in control of Illyricum as well.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200038"><sup>38</sup></xref> However, the position of Illyricum within the administrative structures was hereby not settled.</p>
<p>In reaction to the invasion of the usurper Magnus Maximus into Italy in 387 and Valentinian <sc>II</sc>&#x2019;s flight to Thessalonica, negotiations between Valentinian and Theodosius once again led to the latter&#x2019;s control over Illyricum.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200039"><sup>39</sup></xref> The battle against Maximus brought Theodosius to Italy where he stayed until 391 before returning to Constantinople. Nevertheless, the responsibility over the central prefecture of Africa, Italy, and Illyricum seem to have remained in Theodosius&#x2019; hands as it had become clear that Valentinian <sc>II</sc> was too weak an emperor to exercise firm control over the western half of the empire. In August 390, Theodosius had appointed Virius Nicomachius Flavianus as Praetorian Prefect over the central prefecture.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200040"><sup>40</sup></xref> However, during Flavianus&#x2019; term of office the emperor Valentinian <sc>II</sc> died in 392 and subsequently Theodosius appointed Apodemius as Praetorian Prefect over Illyricum and in the following months over Africa as well, thus leaving Flavianus with Italy.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200041"><sup>41</sup></xref> Theodosius was left as the sole emperor, but immediately had to deal with the usurpation of Eugenius and Arbogast, who had moved into Italy in 393 and whose side Flavianus had taken. Eugenius consolidated Flavianus&#x2019; appointment of Praetorian Prefect of Italy. Errington seems to suggest that Flavianus&#x2019; desertion to Eugenius&#x2019; side might have been caused by frustration over the removal of Illyricum and Africa from his prefecture.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200042"><sup>42</sup></xref> However, one might also argue that in his attempt to secure the regions of his empire, Theodosius realised, on the one hand, that the central prefecture was too large for one praetorian prefect to handle, and on the other hand, that Flavianus might not turn out to be as reliable as he had hoped. This latter point is obviously speculative, but it became a reality once Flavianus deserted the Theodosian government to join forces with Eugenius. Flavianus&#x2019; choice proved to be a bad one, as Theodosius would win a final battle at Frigidus in September 394. With his appointments of men in high offices Theodosius shows that he was well aware of the importance of choosing qualified and especially loyal men.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200043"><sup>43</sup></xref></p>
<p>The dealings with the region of Illyricum are illustrative for the struggle for power at the highest level in the sense that stability in that region proved to be vital for the imperial authority, either in its fight against the Goths as well as in internal wars over the imperial position. Clearly, the geographical centrality as a gateway between East and West was considered crucial for the empire&#x2019;s security. It was also during these decades, perhaps at some stage between the invasion of Magnus Maximus into Italy in 387 and the final years of the fourth century, that the regions that together made up the prefecture of Illyricum were not a logical or practical unit. Thus, it was decided, perhaps by Theodosius himself, even though we have no evidence of the actual decision making process, that Illyricum was to be split up in such a way that the dioceses of Dacia and Macedonia together would make up the prefecture of Illyricum, whereas Pannonia which had always had strong connections with northern Italy ended up as part of Africa and Italy.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200044"><sup>44</sup></xref> By the end of the fourth century, at the beginning of the rule of Theodosius&#x2019; sons Arcadius and Honorius, the four prefectures of the empire seem to be in place.</p>

<title>Theodosius <sc>I</sc> and the Dioceses</title>
<p>By the end of the fourth century, most of the dioceses were clearly established from a geographical point of view, yet there was still discussion about the position, authority and responsibility of the leading officials, in most dioceses called the <italic>vicarius</italic> (Aegyptus with its <italic>Praefectus Augustalis</italic> and Oriens with its <italic>Comes Orientis</italic> were in title exceptions though their duties appear to be the same). From the period of Theodosius&#x2019; reign there are four laws that address these issues, showing that the emperors were still in the process of positioning the <italic>vicarii</italic> within the hierarchy of officials.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200045"><sup>45</sup></xref> These also demonstrate that one cannot simplify the system of officials into some type of hierarchical arrangement by placing praetorian prefects at the top, followed by the <italic>vicarii</italic>, and then by the provincial governors. The latter type of official had various levels and ranks, as proconsuls for instance were higher in rank than <italic>vicarii</italic>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200046"><sup>46</sup></xref> The laws also show that the emperors considered it their responsibility to clarify the privileges and limits of the various offices.</p>
<p>During the rule of Theodosius, three adjustments to the territories of the dioceses seem to be made. Remarkably, while dioceses had started to appear from the reign of Constantine onwards, by the final two decades of the fourth century three major territorial changes took place. First, whereas Aegyptus in the early fourth century had been part of the diocese of Oriens, around 381 &#x2013; thus during the joint rule of Valentinian <sc>II</sc>, Gratian and Theodosius &#x2013; Aegyptus became a diocese in its own right, independent from Oriens.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200047"><sup>47</sup></xref> Although this seems to have been a serious change, in practice this might also be seen as a confirmation of the status quo throughout the entire fourth century. Under Diocletian Egypt had been divided into several provinces, but had also continued to have its own official for the entire region of Egypt, the <italic>praefectus Aegypti</italic>, who eventually became to be called the <italic>praefectus Augustalis</italic>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200048"><sup>48</sup></xref></p>
<p>Second, as discussed in the previous section, the prefecture of Illyricum was altered in that Pannonia would be disconnected from Illyricum and assigned to the prefecture of Italy, while Dacia and Macedonia would together comprise the prefecture of Illyricum.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200049"><sup>49</sup></xref></p>
<p>Third, on the Verona List of the early fourth century the dioceses of Galliae and Viennensis are mentioned, but by the end of the fourth century these were combined into the diocese of Septem Provinciae. The merger of the two dioceses of Galliae, with its eighth provinces, and Viennensis, with its seven provinces, into the one diocese Septem Provinciae must have occurred in the final decade of the fourth century. As Mathisen has argued, this might have been part of an administrative organisation by the usurper Magnus Maximus who had turned Quinque Provinciae into Septem Provinciae (with an increase of two more provinces, Lugdunensis tertia and Lugdunensis senonia). However, once Maximus was defeated in 388, Theodosius together with his co-rulers Valentinian and Arcadius officially had Maximus&#x2019; acts as emperor nullified: &#x2018;We condemn every decision which Maximus, the most nefarious of tyrants, conceived in his crafty mind and supposed that he should promulgate, thus rendering injustice instead of justice. Therefore, no man shall flatter himself with any law or decision of the tyrant&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200050"><sup>50</sup></xref> Notably, even with this imperial and legal rejection, within Gaul the name Septem Provinciae seems to have been used, but in official documentation outside of Gaul it was Quinque Provinciae. A law from the year 400 shows that the imperial government officially had started to speak of Septem Provinciae.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200051"><sup>51</sup></xref></p>
<p>This case of Gaul reveals a notable and conscious expression of imperial power which for Theodosius could only have led to the rejection of Magnus Maximus&#x2019; acts. In Theodosius&#x2019; eyes Maximus had been a usurper, even though for a while the emperor seems to have tolerated Maximus&#x2019; ruling position in the West. Some type of negotiations between Theodosius and his eastern court, Valentinian in the West, and Maximus might have led to a geographical division along lines of great praetorian prefectures with Maximus having control over the Gallic prefecture until Maximus broke this deal when he invaded Italy, thereby forcing Theodosius eventually into action.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200052"><sup>52</sup></xref> When Maximus was killed, and Theodosius was the most dominant partner of the three emperors &#x2013; Valentinian <sc>II</sc> having become too weak and Theodosius&#x2019; son Arcadius still a minor &#x2013; Theodosius would have been leading in the actions taken upon the defeat of Maximus.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN200053"><sup>53</sup></xref> Clearly, he decided that Maximus&#x2019; image and deeds had to be erased from history, a well-known fate for unsuccessful claimants to the throne. Unfortunately, it is not clear to us why Maximus had chosen this change, that he might have considered as practical and a possible improvement for the empire&#x2019;s administrative functioning. Eventually, Maximus&#x2019; alterations of the Gallic dioceses were indeed accepted some years after Theodosius&#x2019; death.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This contribution presents the first steps towards a more in-depth analysis of a topic that deserves further scholarly attention, i.e. the way in which specific historical situations, individual emperors, and the daily (administrative) structure of the empire were more intertwined than we tend to acknowledge in modern scholarship. The case of Theodosius lends itself well for an analysis that attempts to link the various domains of emperorship. When he came to the throne, he not only had to stabilise the regions of Illyricum that had been disrupted by Gothic wars, but had to deal with usurpation as well. While trying to deal with such extraordinary occurrences, Theodosius continued the typical imperial administrative business by issuing legislation and appointing the highest civil officials in the empire such as praetorian prefects, urban prefects or consuls.</p>
<p>However, there is much more to be said about Theodosius, which still has to be unearthed. For instance, one could undertake a prosopographical study of all his high officials, including the city prefects as it would also be valuable to get insights into the men he left behind in Constantinople (or Rome) when he went on campaign. Unfortunately, we do not always have ancient evidence for the involvement of the emperor in appointments, but a detailed prosopographical study might bring more (family) connections to the fore than we are aware of so far. At this stage, the ancient evidence leaves us with the impression that Theodosius mainly dealt with the appointments of men in the highest offices such as the praetorian prefect in the case of the provincial government. If so, that means that the praetorian prefects were responsible for the appointments of the <italic>vicarii</italic> and the provincial governors.</p>
<p>We have seen that some regions obtained more of Theodosius&#x2019; attention, such as Illyricum, although out of clear political and military reasons. Again, the evidence not always allows us to precisely indicate what the emperor decided, but it is often clear that Theodosius himself must have been involved because of the implication of a decision and its consequences, in particular for the stability of crucial regions of the empire. He simply could not afford not to be involved, even though he himself was preoccupied by trying to fight off enemies, both from outside and inside the empire&#x2019;s territory. Finally, as a further suggestion for future research, it would also be valuable to connect Theodosius&#x2019; movements and actions to the particular legislation that the issued while being away from his capital.</p>
<p>Furthermore, once an analysis of Theodosius would be more complete, it would also be worthwhile to explore in a similar fashion the ways in which his imperial predecessors, his co-rulers as well as the successors of the Theodosian dynasty dealt with or were involved in the functioning of the administrative structures of the empire. That would certainly advance our understanding of the close connection between individual emperors, administrative structures and empire wide developments in the late fourth century even further.</p>

Its name was changed into the diocese of Illyricum, which in itself is puzzling as eventually a prefecture called Illyricum was created as well and has created confusion among scholars when trying to understand the ancient sources.
